      <description>When Zohran Mamdani won the primary race for New York mayor, the Democratic establishment's lukewarm response echoed the treatment of another charismatic, unconventional candidate decades earlier. This week, we bring you the story of Harold Washington, the greatest politician you've probably never heard of, and the backlash that ensued when he became Chicago's first Black mayor.

Prologue
As New York City’s Democratic establishment attempts to resist the candidacy of Zohran Mamdani, we look back at another mayoral candidate who upset the established political machine. (7 minutes)

Act One
A history of the brief mayoral career of Harold Washington and its lessons for Black and white America, as told by people close to him. (39 minutes)

Act Two
Ira revisits interviews with Chicago voters from the 1997 and 2007 rebroadcasts of this episode. In 1997, ten years after Harold Washington’s death, not much had changed in Chicago. By 2007, attitudes had begun to shift slowly, and another Black politician from Chicago was on the rise — Barack Obama. Ira also speaks to David Axelrod, an advisor to both Harold Washington and Barack Obama. (10 minutes)

      <description>Stories of people who try simple mind games on others, and then find themselves way in over their heads.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass interviews Lori Gottlieb about the time she sent a letter to a writer in a magazine, a letter packed with white lies. (5 minutes)

Act One
Lori Gottlieb's story continues. One complication led to another, and before long, the writer seemed to be lying to her. Or maybe he wasn't. It was hard to tell. Years later, she still isn't sure what happened. (8 minutes)

Act Two
A group called Improv Everywhere decides that an unknown band, Ghosts of Pasha, playing their first ever tour in New York, ought to think they're a smash hit. So they study the band's music and then crowd the performance, pretending to be hard-core fans. Improv Everywhere just wants to make the band happy—to give them the best day of their lives. But the band doesn't see it that way. Nor does another subject of one of Improv Everywhere's &quot;missions.&quot; (31 minutes)

Act Three
Scott Carrier and his family live in the same Salt Lake City neighborhood as Elizabeth Smart, the fourteen-year-old whose 2002 kidnapping made international news. Though Smart's picture was plastered everywhere throughout Salt Lake City and thousands of volunteers searched for her, her captors brazenly brought her back to the very neighborhood from which she'd been taken. They walked freely through the streets with her in broad daylight, yet no one recognized her. Scott talks with his neighbors and his son Milo—who had attended grade school with Smart—about what was going through their minds that prevented them from seeing what was right there in plain sight. (12 minutes)

      <description>Trump has a plan for his second term: retribution. We check in with the people who’ve crossed him.

Prologue
Donald Trump has talked about taking revenge on his enemies since the early days of his 2024 presidential campaign. Ira Glass talks to reporter Jonathan Karl about how Trump has placed retribution at the center of his run and what we know about how he’s thinking about it. (16 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Reporter Alix Spiegel talks to two people with good reason to fear a second Trump administration. Former White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham spent six years with the Trumps but resigned after January 6th and wrote a scathing tell-all book about her experience. Fred Wellman worked for The Lincoln Project - a group of high-profile Republicans who pledged to keep Trump out of office during the 2020 campaign. (22 minutes)
By Alix Spiegel

Act Two
Alex Vindman became the face of the first Trump impeachment after he reported to his superiors that Trump had asked the President of Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of his political opponent. At the time, Vindman believed that his Congressional testimony would not jeopardize him; now, he and his wife Rachel are having second thoughts. (14 minutes)

      <description>Majid believed that if he could testify in court about what happened to him at a CIA black site, he would be given a break. Was he right?

Prologue

Act Three
Ira accompanies photographer Tamara Staples as she attempts to photograph chickens in the style of high fashion photography. The chickens are not very cooperative. (15 minutes) Tamara's photos have been collected in a book, The Magnificent Chicken: Portraits of the Fairest Fowl .

      <description>Ron DeSantis says he'll do for America what he's done for Florida. So what's it like in Florida?

Florida is now the fastest growing state, and DeSantis says people are moving there from all over because of him. We speak to people who did make the move, at least in part, for DeSantis’s policies. (6  minutes)
By Ira Glass ; Produced by Alaa Mostafa

Act One
Among the big items in DeSantis's run for president is medical freedom. Producer Zoe Chace wanted to understand its appeal and its growing popularity.

Act Two
DeSantis has passed law after law about what can and can’t be taught in Florida classrooms, starting as early as elementary school. And last spring, Florida Republicans introduced a bill initially proposing to ban things like critical race theory and identity politics, or students majoring in things like gender studies in Florida universities. Reporter Emmanuel Dzotsi followed how things unfolded at one of the biggest universities there, Florida State, from the bill’s introduction all the way to its passage. He explains how professors and students have been preparing. (25 minutes)

      <description>Five years after the #MeToo explosion, what’s happened in the lives of the women who went public with their stories?

Prologue
Some powerful and well known men lost their jobs after #MeToo. But what about the women at the center of all this who’ve been way less visible after they told what happened to them? We hear about big and small ways the aftermath of coming forward continues to pop up in their daily lives. (10 minutes) Jules Woodson’s nonprofit is Help; Hear; Heal . Tanya Selvaratnam is the author of the memoir Assume Nothing: A Story of Intimate Violence .
By Ira Glass ; Produced by Valerie Kipnis

Act One
Back in 2021, a 19-year-old intern at the Idaho state legislature reported that a state Representative named Aaron von Ehlinger raped her. She went by the name Jane Doe. There was a public ethics hearing and Ehlinger resigned. State legislators talked about how proud they were of their ability to do the right thing so quickly. But the story that the public knows is very different from what actually happened to Jane. She talks about it in-depth for the first time. (25 minutes)
By Miki Meek

Act Two
Jane Doe walks into a public ethics hearing at the Idaho state capitol and navigates the aftermath. (23 minutes) Song: “Here We Have Idaho” Fiona Apple (vocals) Amy Wood (drums and percussion) David Garza (acoustic guitar, electric guitar, piano, vocals) Sabastian Steinberg (bass, electric autoharp, vocals) John Would (tremolo guitar) Engineered by John Would, Amy Wood, Fiona Apple Mixed and mastered by John Would

      <description>We talk to people who wanted abortions right when the laws were changing in their states.

Prologue
Nine months ago, these people wanted abortions. But then, the laws changed. They had to wait to get an appointment, figure out how to get out of state or order abortion pills.  In that waiting, other things happened. (5 minutes) Today’s show was inspired by the excellent reporting of Caroline Kitchener. You can read more of her work at The Washington Post .

Act One
In the months following the court’s decision, two women are stalled getting abortions. Reporter Caroline Kitchener follows Kae and Taylor in those early months, as they try to figure out what to do. And we see what happens when both women each come into contact with the anti-abortion movement. (19 minutes)
By Caroline Kitchener

Act Two
Doctors say one effect of the new bans is people seeking abortions much later into their second trimesters. Caroline got interested in a girl like that in Oklahoma. (18 minutes) We recorded the Abortion and Miscarriage hotline with the Nocturnists Podcast .

      <description>The government isn’t doing much to prevent school shootings. So parents are jumping in — and getting results.

Prologue
There's a whole infrastructure that springs into action when a mass shooting occurs. There's the police and SWAT teams, the Red Cross, the Billy Graham prayer truck, therapy dogs. And then there’s a couple – Sandy and Lonnie Phillips – whose daughter died in a mass shooting. What they do seems to really help. (2 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Sandy and Lonnie’s daughter, Jessi, died back in 2012, when a gunman opened fire in a movie theater in Aurora, Colo. Since then, they’ve organized their whole lives to be able to reach out to other parents like themselves. Producer Miki Meek traveled with them to Sante Fe, Texas, right after a school shooting. (23 minutes)

      <description>Stories about Vladimir Putin.

Prologue
Late at night on the evening Russia invaded Ukraine, Ira talks to two people who escaped to Lviv, near the Polish border: a woman we call Natalie, and the Ukraine Correspondent for The Economist, Richard Ensor. Natalie’s harrowing story about escaping Kyiv is not the sort of war story that makes you think, &quot;I can't imagine what it'd be like to go through that.” In fact it’s just the opposite. For anyone who’s ever lived in a sizable city, it’s shockingly, instantly easy to imagine, because every moment of her story happens in such familiar sorts of places. (11 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Back in 1999 there was series of bombings of apartment buildings in Moscow and across Russia. 300 people died. It happened just as Vladimir Putin was coming to power. And there was a question whether Putin or other people in the Kremlin might have been involved.  Producer Robyn Semien talked to reporters who covered the bombings and reviewed the evidence. (20 minutes)
By Robyn Semien

Act Two
Vladmir Putin’s approval rating among Russians is always stunningly high. Ira talks to reporter Charles Maynes to find out if that number is real and how it could be that high. Then Charles talks to a Putin supporter who explains why she loves her president. (10 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act Three
Disinformation and propaganda works differently in Putin’s Russia than it did during the Soviet Union. Instead of tamping down the opposition, the Russian government works to control the opposition. Producer Sean Cole introduces us to Putin’s former right hand man who was credited with inventing this new way of controlling information. One of the journalists Sean speaks to in this story is Peter Pomerantsev. He’s the author of the book, &quot; Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia .&quot; (15 minutes)

Act One
The police chief in Muskegon conducts his own personal investigation into Officer Anderson’s interactions with Black people on the job. He doesn’t like what he discovers. (6  minutes)
By Ben Calhoun

Act Two
Officer Anderson is fired based on the chief’s findings. But that’s not what’s said publicly. In fact, the official investigation released by the city makes no mention of Officer Anderson’s history with Black residents in Muskegon, much to the chagrin of some of the Black residents of Muskegon. (3 minutes)

Act Three
Muskegon’s chief of police explains why he decided he couldn’t mention any of the stuff he found troubling about Officer Anderson’s treatment of Black people on the job. No regrets! (6 minutes)

Act Four
Duke Stalling, whose mother’s birthday party was pepper sprayed by Officer Anderson when he showed up on a noise complaint, reacts to the city’s deal with Anderson. (6 minutes)

Act Five
Turns out, the couple who originally brought Officer Anderson into the spotlight with their Facebook post had encountered Anderson before in Muskegon. Specifically, at a traffic stop where things got ugly. This is publicized in the city’s official report on Anderson, and the Mathises suffer further threats and harassment as a result. (13 minutes)

Act Six
The Mathises consider if going public with what they found in Officer Anderson’s house was worth it, given what their personal lives have been like since. (5 minutes)

      <description>What happens when one family goes all in on fighting climate change.

Prologue
So yes, climate change is real and most Americans believe that’s what we’re seeing around us right now. But there are people out there who look at the same evidence the rest of us do and take it to heart in a way most of us don’t. They have a wake-up moment. (5 minutes)

      <description>What the day-to-day business of saving the world looks like.

Prologue
To fight those massive fires out west, there are these camps hidden from view. If you were driving by, you might not even know they’re there. We visited one of them in central California for the Creek Fire — one of the largest fires in the state’s history. Hundreds of people were living and working there, trying to put the fire out. The first crew we met was this young group of twenty-somethings who spend all day, every day, untangling miles and miles of fire hoses. Producer Miki Meek talks to them. (5 minutes)
By Miki Meek

Act One
We heard about these fire camps from Lizzie Johnson. She’s a reporter at The San Francisco Chronicle and spends most of the year chasing fires around California. She took Miki and one of our other producers, Lilly Sullivan, to the Creek Fire camp with her and has stories of people doing all kinds of jobs you never think about — from laundry to printing maps and hiking out to the farthest corners of a blaze.

      <description>The not-often-talked-about realm of licensing boards, and the disturbing decisions they sometimes make.

Prologue
For the past couple-two-three weeks, producer Ben Calhoun has been calling around to small town municipal clerks in his home state of Wisconsin, asking them how mail-in balloting really works. It can be chaotic, they say, but not in the way the president would have you believe. Ben tells Ira what he learned. (11 minutes)
By Ira Glass Ben Calhoun

Act One
Law professor Rebecca Allensworth has been studying another realm of civic-minded individuals charged with helping society function: medical licensing boards. They’re mostly doctors deciding whether other doctors should be allowed to keep practicing medicine. But they don’t always get it right. Sometimes with disturbing results. Producer Dana Chivvis reports on what Rebecca uncovered. (16 minutes)

      <description>Producer Chana Joffe-Walt investigates the inordinate power of white parents at one ordinary public school.

Prologue
When the trailer was released for Chana Joffe-Walt’s new show, it prompted a kind of online war. Within a week, people left thousands of ratings and comments: some saying it was divisive and racist; others saying the opposite. But nobody had even heard the show yet. Ira Glass talks about what the discussion illuminates about the show and about this moment. (2 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
In just one year, everything in one ordinary public middle school changed. It went from an incoming class of thirty sixth graders—most of them Black, Latino, and Middle Eastern—to a class of 103 sixth graders. The influx was driven by wealthy white students. Producer Chana Joffe-Walt follows how that works out. (29 minutes)

      <description>We return to our story about Abdi Nor from 2015, with some news about his life today.

Prologue
Three weeks ago, Abdi Nor became a U.S. citizen, in a ceremony in Maine. We go to the ceremony, and then head back in time to 2013, when he won a visa under the Diversity Visa Lottery.
By Ira Glass

Act One
It turns out winning the lottery is only the first step in trying to come to America. More than half of the people who win each year never make it. Abdi is living in Nairobi, Kenya, when he wins, and as he's trying to prepare for his interview at the U.S. Embassy, Kenyan police start relentlessly raiding his neighborhood, rounding up Somalis and taking them away. So Abdi goes into hiding in his apartment. Leo Hornak spoke to Abdi almost every night while this was happening, to find out if Abdi would evade the police and make it to America. (17 minutes) Abdi has a memoir called &quot; Call Me American .&quot;

      <description>Radical change comes to an Argentinian talk show.

Host Ira Glass talks with Washington Post reporter Kevin Sieff , who has been following a lawyer trying to reunite a father with his 12-year-old daughter.

By Kevin Sieff

Act One
Reporter Jasmine Garsd grew up in Argentina watching talk shows, which were kind of extreme even for Latin American television.

Jasmine went back to Argentina to find out what had happened. This story is a collaboration with the NPR podcast Rough Translation . (23 minutes)

      <description>Before Democrats slug it out with Republicans, they’re slugging out with each other.

Host Ira Glass talks with Ben Calhoun about how Democrats are furiously trying to retake New York’s 19th congressional district. The sitting Republican is considered very vulnerable, and has been the subject of weekly protests that even have a house band. Nationally, Democrats are watching what’s happening in the district. They consider it one of the crucial seats they need to win back to retake the House. But the Democratic primary in NY-19 has been characterized by messy infighting playing out the stubborn split between the progressive and establishment wings of the party. (6 minutes)
By Ben Calhoun

Act One
When Jeff Beals learned who was going to run in the Democratic primary for NY-19, he was disappointed. Beals, a progressive, thought the Democrats jumping in were conventional candidates, ones who embodied what he thinks is a failed strategy for his party: raising lots of money from big donors and lobbyists, and buying TV ads. So Beals decided to run as well—to take his progressive ideas and strategy and face off with the mainstream candidates he didn’t like. Beals learns many things in Democratic politics are slanted against candidates like him. Producer Ben Calhoun spent months with him. (28 minutes)

      <description>Before he leaves the Senate for good, Republican Jeff Flake is trying to get a bill passed.

Producer Zoe Chace talks with host Ira Glass about following Senator Jeff Flake, and how when he announced his retirement she thought her reporting had ended. But when a Democrat was elected to the senate in Alabama, Flake suddenly found new relevance — in Republican Party politics, and also in the senate where his lame-duck vote now held incredible sway.

Senator Jeff Flake goes to the White House and discovers a president who seems to be very open to doing whatever immigration deal the senate brings him. He spends an optimistic 24 hours writing a bill with his bipartisan partners. (17 minutes)
By Zoe Chace

Act Three
Senator Jeff Flake breaks from the plan and speaks openly about the bipartisan DACA proposal to the media before the president has a chance to sell the deal himself. Turns out, that’s not what actually kills the deal. (6 minutes)

Prologue
Ira wonders aloud, when it comes to DACA, with broad support from most Americans, including the majority of Trump voters, leaders of both parties and the president himself: Why is a permanent solution so hard? Why are politics so hard? (2 minutes)

      <description>When an Alabama town went from 98% white to one-fourth Latino, what did it mean for taxpayers, schools, traffic, crime?


Act One
In the early years, when immigrants first arrived in Albertville, the things that bothered the locals weren’t the things you usually hear about when people talk about immigration. Not jobs or wages or crime. It was small stuff. Neighbor-to-neighbor stuff. (19 minutes)
By Ira Glass Miki Meek

Act Two
Latino residents decided to organize a peaceful march in support of a path to legal status, and their white neighbors were shocked when 5,000 people poured into the streets. (3 minutes)
By Ira Glass Miki Meek

Act Three
Suddenly realizing just how many Latinos had moved to town, longtime residents jumped into action, fueled by a wave of national and statewide anti-immigration fever. Then in 2011, Alabama adopted the most extreme anti-immigrant law in the country. (19 minutes)
By Ira Glass Miki Meek

Act Four
One of the things we were excited to investigate when we went to Alabama was to answer the question at the heart of the immigration debate: what does it cost taxpayers when we let in millions of immigrants, documented and undocumented? In Albertville, how much was it? We asked economist Kim Rueben and her colleague Erin Huffer to run the numbers. (6 minutes)

      <description>What really happened when undocumented workers showed up in one Alabama town?

Prologue
Today's show came out of something we heard politicians saying. And we wondered — is that true? And the answer set us on this eight-month journey on which we started to learn all kinds of things that we had never imagined.

Act One
We’ve visited Albertville, Alabama many times now, to figure out exactly what happened when the population shifted from 98% white in 1990, to a fourth Latino twenty years later. We interviewed more than one hundred people. Sessions is not totally right, but he’s not totally wrong either. Our main witnesses to what happened in the plants are three long-time workers named Pat and Martha and Carlos.(29 minutes)

      <description>What should we make of right-wing groups like the Proud Boys, who believe “the West is the best”?

Last month, after white nationalists and members of the alt-right and offshoot groups descended on Charlottesville, Virginia, and marched with torches, the staff of our show realized something: The guy who organized the rally was a member of a right wing men's group that our producer Zoe Chace had been following for months, long before the rally was planned. And she’d learned that the group had an unlikely spiritual advisor: a liberal, black relationship consultant and comedian named Dante Nero. Ira introduces us to him. (3 minutes)

Dante Nero has been involved in this group for years, since before it even had a name. He’s seen its 
evolution. And he is now deeply disturbed to learn that some members attended the Charlottesville 
rally, including the guy who organized it. Zoe tells Dante's story. (29 minutes)

      <description>In 1967, the first Black students integrated the South’s elite prep schools. One of the main reasons they were there? To benefit the white kids.

Host Ira Glass talks to Mariya Karimjee about a college application essay question. Essay B asks students to imagine a person they might meet in college—someone from a very different background. Ten years ago, Mariya’s mostly white high school classmates in Texas didn’t write about an imaginary person they might meet in the future. They just wrote about the one different person they already knew—Mariya. (15 minutes)
By Mariya Karimjee

Act One
Back in the late 1960s, a wealthy tobacco heiress saw that integration was happening all around the country—except at prep schools in the South. So she set out to find the best Black students in neighborhood public schools—in hopes of teaching the white prep-school students to be less bigoted. Mosi Secret tells the story of how the first two Black students to integrate Virginia Episcopal School succeeded beyond anyone’s expectations. (26 minutes) A version of this story appears in The New York Times Magazine .

      <description>Two towns grapple with the question—who do we let in?

Ira talks to our Senior Producer Brian Reed about a fight that’s been brewing in the remote town of Homer, Alaska over a resolution that states that Homer welcomes immigrants. Which is odd. Because the town has virtually no immigrants. (9 1/2 minutes)

Act One
Brian Reed continues his story about the town of Homer, Alaska. He talked to all sorts of people involved in the debate over whether the town should welcome immigrants. He was particularly interested in one guy. A guy named Ben, who didn’t know what he thought about the resolution. (28 minutes)

Producer Chana Joffe-Walt tells Ira about a man who decided to do a drag act at his child's elementary school talent show. (7 1/2 minutes)
By Chana Joffe-Walt

Act One
Earlier this month, North Korea fired an intercontinental ballistic missile… one powerful enough, news reports said, to reach Alaska. People were shocked. But maybe that was because we were not being real with ourselves about what was going on in North Korea. How did we get to this point? Producer David Kestenbaum has been listening to a podcast called Arms Control Wonk that explains it. (17 1/2 minutes)

Act Two

      <description>Before Trump started his presidential campaign, there was a congressional race that redefined what was possible in American politics.

Vice News producer Reid Cherlin tells Ira about a party he attended in Washington in 2014. At the time he thought everyone there was on the fringe of the right wing, largely irrelevant. Now many of the people who were at that party are the most influential figures in Donald Trump’s administration. (8 1/2 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
In 2014, in the wake of losing the previous presidential election, the Republican Party had committed itself to immigration reform as its only path to winning elections in the future. Within two years, Donald Trump would be elected on the exact opposite platform, railing against immigration. Producer Zoe Chace tells the story of the Congressional race that inspired that dramatic 180. (33 minutes)

      <description>What it's actually like to live in the confusing information landscape that is Putin's Russia.

Ira talks to Russian reporter Anna Nemtsova in Moscow about the recent subway bombing in St. Petersburg and the conspiracy theories she heard from Russians as soon as news about the bombing started to spread. Anna Nemtsova is a correspondent for The Daily Beast and Newsweek. (5 minutes) Ira quotes this recent article in The Guardian about Putin by Keith Gessen.
By Ira Glass

Act One
Back in 1999 there was a series of bombings of apartment buildings in Moscow and across Russia. 300 people died. It happened just as Vladimir Putin was coming to power. And there was a question whether Putin or other people in the Kremlin might have been involved. Producer Robyn Semien talked to reporters who covered the bombings and reviewed the evidence. (20 minutes) Robyn talks to reporter Scott Anderson in this story. His article &quot;None Dare Call It a Conspiracy&quot; originally appeared in the pages of GQ.
By Robyn Semien

Act Two
Vladmir Putin’s approval rating is a seemingly unreal 84%. Ira talks to reporter Charles Maynes to find out if that number is real and how it could be that high. Then Charles talks to a Putin supporter who explains why she loves her president. (10 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act Three
Disinformation and propaganda works differently in Putin’s Russia than it did during the Soviet Union. Instead of tamping down the opposition, the Russian government works to control the opposition. Producer Sean Cole introduces us to Putin’s right-hand man who is credited with inventing this new way of controlling information. (15 minutes) One of the journalists Sean speaks to in this story is Peter Pomerantsev. He’s the author of the book &quot;Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia.&quot; Peter Pomerantsev wrote about Vladislav Surkov for The Atlantic .

      <description>We document what happened when the President’s executive order went into effect temporarily banning travel from seven countries.

This week we document what happened when the President’s executive order went into effect, and talk about the way it was implemented. A major policy change thrown into the world like a fastball with no warning. It’s hard not to ask: “What just happened? What was that all about?” (13 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
The news of the executive order broke while immigrants and refugees were mid-flight. That meant they were stranded in airports around the country. Zoe Chace has one of their stories, from JFK. (10 minutes)
By Zoe Chace
Song:“Hey!” by Narcy

Act Two
One of the justifications for the executive order from the administration was that we needed to temporarily stop admitting immigrants and refugees from these seven countries in order to scrutinize and improve the vetting process. Ira speaks with the vetters about how they vet and what they make of the new order. (11 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act Three
There is one line in the executive order that justifies its existence. It’s the second sentence in section 1. Nancy Updike scrutinizes this line of reasoning. (9 minutes)
By Nancy Updike
Song:“Give Me Your Tired Your Poor” by The Suntones

Act Four
Ira talks with a very skeptical national security expert about whether this order actually secures the nation. (8 minutes)

      <description>A story about Hillary Clinton that offers a different picture than what we’ve been hearing from both sides during the campaign.

There’s a political parable about Hillary Clinton that’s made the rounds this year. Host Ira Glass interviews contributor Jack Hitt, who says that in this parable you can see almost every version of Hillary that exists in the popular imagination: the A student, the opportunist, the mastermind, the rat fink, the pragmatist, the truth-twister. (6 minutes)
By Ira Glass Jack Hitt

Act One
Sean Cole talks to reporter Garrett Graff , who read the 247 pages of interview summaries of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails. Graff concludes that it’s not the scandal most people thought it was. Not a sophisticated, Machiavellian scheme to evade federal rules and record laws. The interviews “depict less a sinister and carefully calculated effort to avoid transparency than a busy and uninterested executive who shows little comfort with even the basics of technology, working with a small, harried inner circle of aides. Reading the FBI’s interviews, Clinton’s team hardly seems organized enough to mount any sort of sinister cover-up.” (19 minutes)
By Sean Cole
Song:“Change the Subject” by The Dan Collins Band

Act Two
After Huma Abedin’s emails were discovered on her husband’s computer by the FBI, and after FBI Director James Comey publicly declared the agency would be investigating those emails, Hillary Clinton’s poll numbers dropped.

      <description>Right now a lot of Republicans feel like they don’t recognize their own party.

There’s a seismic, historic change going on in the Republican party this year. Producer Zoe Chace tells Ira about a place you can eavesdrop on a group of Republican friends as they fret and argue about that change week after week: a podcast called Ricochet. Ira talks to Rob Long, one of the hosts of the podcast, and to Avik Roy, who’s appeared on the show. Zoe believes many people in the Republican leadership seem like tragic figures this year. Like Paul Ryan, Speaker of the House. Songwriters Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez imagine what he’s feeling but can’t say publicly. Neil Patrick Harris sings the part of Paul Ryan. Orchestration and music direction: Stephen Oremus. (12 minutes) Emily Bruskin Yarbrough, violin Erin Benim Maryland, violin Jonathan Dinklage, viola Allison Seidner, cello Brian Miller, flute and piccolo Tony Kadleck, trumpet Theodore Primis, horn Recorded and mixed by John Kilgore Program note: In an excerpt of the podcast Ricochet in the prologue to our show, someone misattributes a quote to the film Jaws that actually was from the movie Miller’s Crossing. Both are great films. The correct quote: &quot;I'd worry a lot less if I thought you were worrying enough.&quot; All parties regret the error.
By Zoe Chace Ira Glass

Act One
One way to understand the split inside the Republican party is to look at immigration. It’s this urgent, emotional issue for so much of the party these days. But why? Over the past year, as producer Zoe Chace has covered the election, she has wondered, why immigration NOW? She had a hard time getting any answers — and then she stumbled upon a small city in Minnesota called St. Cloud. Zoe connects the anti-immigrant sentiment in St. Cloud with a national network of organizations promoting anti-Muslim views and spreading fear about Sharia law. We hear how the Somali immigrants in town deal with their neighbors’ fears. And then a violent attack at a local mall inflames both sides. (44 minutes)

      <description>Watching lies become the truth in the 2016 election.

Ira talks about what’s alarming him about this year’s election: facts seem less meaningful than they ever have, and the gap between the mainstream media and right-wing media’s versions of the world have never seemed further apart. CNN’s Jake Tapper explains what it was like to be on the air live when Donald Trump tried to take a huge, obvious lie and pass it off as the truth. (8 minutes)

Act One
Ira's quest continues. He calls his Uncle Lenny, who gets his news from Fox and the Wall Street Journal, and lives with an entirely different set of facts, and Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration expert at the CATO Institute, who explains that the central issue in Donald Trump’s candidacy is based on something that isn’t true. (11 minutes)

Act Two
In this election year we look at the story of one small ballot initiative, in one state. We heard this referendum would gut Georgia's Judicial Qualifications Commission (JQC), an independent organization that investigates ethics complaints about judges. Years ago, the JQC investigated a judge we did a whole episode about, Amanda Williams, and she resigned from the bench. We wondered why in the world someone would want to tamper with an agency that seemed to be doing a good job at a low cost. Producer David Kestenbaum went to Georgia to figure out what was going on. (21 minutes)

CNN’s Jake Tapper explains what it was like to be on the air live when Donald Trump tried to take a huge, obvious lie and pass it off as the truth. (8 minutes)

Act One
Ira's quest continues. He calls his Uncle Lenny, who gets his news from Fox and the Wall Street Journal, and lives with an entirely different set of facts, and Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration expert at the CATO Institute, who explains that the central issue in Donald Trump’s candidacy is based on something that isn’t true. (11 minutes)

Act Two
In this election year we look at the story of one small ballot initiative, in one state. We heard this referendum would gut Georgia's Judicial Qualifications Commission (JQC), an independent organization that investigates ethics complaints about judges. Years ago, the JQC investigated a judge we did a whole episode about, Amanda Williams, and she resigned from the bench. We wondered why in the world someone would want to tamper with an agency that seemed to be doing a good job at a low cost. Producer David Kestenbaum went to Georgia to figure out what was going on. (21 minutes)
Act Three

      <description>San Francisco’s Spider-Man dropped into buildings from skylights and leapt 10 feet from one roof to another. But mostly, his talent got him into trouble.

Ira talks to Biba Struja – a Serbian man who says that when he was in high school, he discovered that he seemed to have a high resistance to electricity. It’s a power that he’s utilized, but is mostly a curse. Biba is the subject of the documentary Battery Man . (5 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Awhile back, San Francisco experienced a rash of burglaries that all fit a pattern. The suspect got into businesses at night through skylights, or the attic, and then lowered himself in with ropes where he would rob safes. The cops dubbed him Spider-Man. Our producer Karen Duffin would later find out that Spider-Man was someone she had a connection to. (24 minutes)
By Karen Duffin

Act Two

      <description>The older and wiser we get, the more bewildering our past decisions can seem.

A year ago, we did a story about a study that found that a simple 20-minute conversation could change someone’s mind about controversial issues like gay marriage and abortion. But a few weeks after we aired the story, the study was discredited. A couple of researchers decided to redo the experiment the right way, and released their results this week. (3 minutes)

Even when an animal is not a pest, not chewing up homes or spreading disease or biting average citizens, even when it is universally loved, it can still wreak havoc when it arrives in our world.

      <description>Stories, tributes, and attempts to understand the Chairman of the Board.

Host Ira Glass, with a recording of a 1962 Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy 
Davis Jr., appearance at the Villa Venice, a club outside Chicago. What's fascinating 
about Sinatra is how he is so many different people at once, and they're all on display 
in this recording: sentimental crooner, cruel woman-baiter, bully, goofball. Writer Rennie 
Sparks makes the case that Sinatra is mesmerizing because he's every man, every 
possible man, all rolled into one.

(3 minutes)
By John Connors Ira Glass

Act Four
Michael Ventura, who grew up Sicilian in New York, says that as a kid he thought Sinatra was in his family. His book The Death of Frank Sinatra is not really about Sinatra. It's about men like Ventura, who drew part of their style and sense of self from Frank. He reads from the only section in the book where Sinatra actually appears: an account of a Sinatra concert, circa 1994. He says he wanted to write about the older Sinatra because the older Sinatra contains all the ages of Sinatra. All of them come forward when he sings. (11 minutes)

      <description>Emily Dickinson said “The heart wants what it wants.” This week, stories from people who take that notion to extremes and are unapologetic about it.

Ira talks to a man in his 70s who’s about to travel across the country to tell a woman he loves how he really feels, despite some very real signs that doing so might be a bad idea. (8 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Jesse had been waiting his whole life to fall in love—and then he started getting these letters from the perfect woman, Pamala. She seemed vulnerable. In need of protection. A classic beauty. He was totally devoted. They corresponded for years. And when something happens that really should change how he feels about her— he just can’t give it up. NPR’s social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam reports the story. He hosts the podcast Hidden Brain . (31 minutes)
By Shankar Vedantam

Act Two
Comedian Elsa Waithe tells about going to Time’s Square to take part in the Black Lives Matter protests, and winding up with a huge crush on her arresting officer. (9 minutes)

      <description>Conspiracy theories about the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin continue to shape Israel's politics and future.

Ira talks to producer Nancy Updike and reporter Dan Ephron, about their interview with the accomplice, Hagai Amir, who showed them the house where he and his brother plotted the murder and the shed where he machined special bullets. Israelis on the street tell Updike and Ephron they don’t believe the Hagai and Yigal Amir did it.
By Dan Ephron Nancy Updike

Act One
Updike and Ephron reconstruct the night of the murder, with Ephron describing what he recalls (he reported from Israel at the time and covered the rally where Rabin was assassinated). A police investigator talks about interrogating Amir in the hours after the assassination. The shooter confessed immediately, describing how he killed Rabin to stop peace deals with the Palestinians. The pathologist who performed Rabin’s autopsy says it was a clear cut case, nothing unusual. And then Hillel Weiss, a right-wing activist, lays out his conspiracy theory: Rabin staged an attempt on his own life in order to boost his public standing and smear his opponents on the right. It was supposed to be a thwarted assassination attempt but something went wrong and he died in the process.

      <description>Meet the people who pitch ideas for new foods and then decide which ones they're actually going to make.

Ira talks about the phenomenon of weird food mashups that fast food companies started selling in the last five years – things like the pizza with hot dogs on the crust that Pizza Hut made or the Hardee's burger with a cheesesteak as the topping on the burger. Ira explains that there is something about these foods that he's been wondering about. There must be a group of people who pitch ideas for new foods and then decide which ones they're actually going to make. What is like to be in that room? (6 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Producer Zoe Chace gets into the room that Ira has been wondering about. Specifically, the headquarters of fast food chain Hardee's. They've whittled down a list of hundreds of ideas to a dozen sandwiches that they've made and are trying out. Zoe explains how they decide which ones are actually going to make it to market.

      <description>We've always loved to gawk at others, but what's it like when the tables are turned and all eyes are on you?

Prologue
Ira talks to Joel Gold, a psychologist and author, about a strangely common delusion known as the &quot;Truman Show Delusion,&quot; in which patients believe that they are being filmed, 24/7, for a national reality television program. (6 minutes)

Act One
Producer Stephanie Foo speaks to Nasubi, a Japanese comedian who, in the 90s, just wanted a little bit of fame. So he was thrilled when he won an opportunity to have his own segment on a Japanese reality TV show . Until he found out the premise: he had to sit in an empty apartment with no food, clothes or contact with the outside world, enter sweepstakes from magazines… and hope that he won enough sustenance to survive. (23 minutes) The Contestant is a new documentary based on this story, coming to Hulu on May 2.
By Stephanie Foo

Act Two
Writer Ariel Sabar tells the story of Roger Barker, a psychologist who believed humans should be studied outside the lab. So Barker dispatched an army of graduate students to follow the children of Oskaloosa, Kansas, and write down every single thing they did. Sabar wrote a book about Roger Barker called &quot; The Outsider .&quot; (8 minutes)

      <description>We go to the Lower 9th Ward in New Orleans to talk to residents about what matters most to them ten years after the hurricane.

Residents of the Lower 9th Ward in New Orleans felt so strongly against hurricane tours after the storm, that legislation made the bus tours illegal there. Ira Glass talks to residents about the problem with bus tours, and takes us on a walking tour of the area, to meet people who are there now, 10 years after the storm. (7 minutes)

Act 1
Robyn Semien talks to St. Claude Internet Café owner Kirk Washington about what’s changed the most in his life, post-Katrina. She finds out it’s literally everything, every minute, every day. (11 minutes)
By Robyn Semien

Act 2
Zoe Chace goes to a favorite bar of the Lower 9th Ward: Mercede’s Place. She finds people who want so badly to go back to their lives before the storm, but know they can’t. (9 minutes)
By Zoe Chace

Act 3
Lots of people in the lower 9th ward believe that the levees were exploded by the US government, and that’s why their neighborhood ended up under water. This makes a lot of sense when you learn about what happened in that same place in 1927. (6 minutes)

Act 4
A lot of people lost their homes during Katrina, but a lot of people lost their homes afterward, too—in ten years of post-storm debt, foreclosures, and hard loans. Zoe Chace talked with Roy Bradley, a Saints fan who’s facing losing his house right after he rebuilt it. (11 minutes)
By Zoe Chace

Act 5
Someone has moved into Kirk Washington’s friend’s house—the guy from the first stop, whose friend died during Katrina. Her name is Sarah. Producer Sean Cole talked to her about what it’s like to move to a neighborhood, and into a house, that lost so much during the storm. (11 minutes)

Act 6
Lots of people don’t remember the storm: like people who are just becoming adolescents today.

Prologue

Act One

      <description>A city goes all out to integrate its schools.

Chana Joffe-Walt talks to Kiana, who went to a school that was overwhelmingly black and Latino, 
but when some white students showed up one day on an exchange program, she went up to them 
eagerly.  And since then, has embarked on a one-woman school integration program.  Among other 
things, she wanted to see “white wasted.” (9 minutes)
By Chana Joffe-Walt

Act One
Chana Joffe-Walt reports on the Hartford, CT school system, which actively seeks to integrate.  The 
results have been impressive.  It used to be that 11% of Hartford students were in integrated schools.
Now it’s nearly half.  But the trick to the whole thing is: convince white families it’s in their self-
interest to go to integrated schools.  This requires the kind of marketing skills and savvy we’re more
used to seeing at Apple and Pepsi than we are at a public school district. (38 minutes) There's a book by Susan Eaton about Hartford's integration plan, called The Children in Room E4 .
By Chana Joffe-Walt

Act Two
Reporter Nikole Hannah-Jones, who has investigated integration in schools for years, joins Chana
Joffe-Walt to interview the Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan. The Obama Administration says
it’s in favor of integrating the schools, but doesn’t seem to do so much to promote it.  They seemed
to have the perfect opportunity, integration advocates say, with their Race to the Top program.  But

Ira speaks with New York Times Magazine Reporter Nikole Hannah-Jones about her years reporting 
on education and the various kinds of school reforms administrators have tried to close the achievement
gap that never seem to work. Nikole says there's one reform that people have pretty much given up
on, despite a lot of evidence that it works – school integration. (11 minutes)
By Nikole Hannah-Jones

Act One
Nikole Hannah-Jones reports on a school district that accidentally stumbled on an integration program
in recent years. It's the Normandy School District in Normandy, Missouri. Normandy is on the border of
Ferguson, Missouri, and the district includes the high school that Michael Brown attended. (30 minutes)

      <description>A car plant in Fremont California that might have saved the U.S. car industry.

Host Ira Glass introduces the story of the New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., aka NUMMI. In 1984, General Motors and Toyota opened NUMMI as a joint venture. Toyota showed GM the secrets of its production system: How it made cars of much higher quality and much lower cost than GM achieved. But today, GM cars still don't have the quality of Japanese imports. GM went bankrupt. And in 2010 NUMMI was closed, sending thousands of car workers looking for jobs. In this hour-long story, which we reported in 2010 , NPR Automotive Correspondent Frank Langfitt tells the story of NUMMI and why GM—and the rest of the American car business—wasn't able to learn from it more quickly. (5 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
The rise of NUMMI, or how one of the worst auto plants in America started producing some of its best cars, thanks to lessons learned from the Toyota production system. (25 1/2 minutes)

      <description>A story about someone who's desperately trying – against long odds – to make it to the United States and become an American.

Prologue
Ira talks to cyber cafe workers around the world about something that lots of Americans have never heard of, but that people in other countries know all about: a lottery run by the U.S. government where the prize is a visa to come to America. Each year people flock to cyber cafes to enter it, hoping for a lucky break that will change their life. In 2014, one of the lottery winners was Abdi Nor, whose story today's show is about. (10 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
It turns out winning the lottery is only the first step in trying to come to America. More than half of the people who win each year never make it. Abdi is living in Nairobi, Kenya, when he wins, and as he's trying to prepare for his interview at the U.S. Embassy, Kenyan police start relentlessly raiding his neighborhood, rounding up Somalis and taking them away. So Abdi goes into hiding in his apartment. Leo Hornak spoke to Abdi almost every night while this was happening, to find out if Abdi would evade the police and make it to America. (17 minutes) Abdi has a memoir out on Tuesday called &quot; Call Me American .&quot;

      <description>Stories of those very infrequent instances where people’s opinions flip on fundamental things that they believe.

Ira introduces “the backfire effect,” a phenomenon stating that when confronted with evidence disproving what we believe, most of us ignore that evidence, dig in and become more entrenched in our beliefs. Which just makes the recordings he plays more surprising—recordings of canvassers going door to door and effectively convincing people to completely flip their positions. (5 1/2 minutes)

Act One
Ira continues to explain how these canvassers learned how to change people’s minds, and talks about the mistakes they made along the way. (18 minutes)

Act Two
Reporter Joe Richman visits a program in Richmond, CA that is trying a controversial method of reducing gun violence in their city: paying criminals to not commit crimes. Sounds crazy, but the even crazier part is…it works. To figure out how, Joe speaks to guys participating in the program, and to Sam Vaughn, a man whose job it is to monitor the criminals' progress and keep them on track. Joe runs the Radio Diaries podcast, where this week you can hear a companion story . (19 minutes)

An agunah is a woman whose husband refuses to give her a divorce – in Hebrew it means &quot;chained wife.&quot; If you're an Orthodox Jew, strictly following Jewish law, the only real way to get divorced is if your husband agrees to hand you a piece of paper called a get. Without the get, women who want out of their marriages can stay chained to their husbands for years. In New York, a couple of rabbis were recently accused of using violence to force men to give their wives a get. (17 minutes) Mark’s latest book is Squirrel Hill: The Tree of Life Synagogue Shooting and the Soul of a Neighborhood .

      <description>There's a division between people who distrust the police and people who see cops as a force for good.

Ira tells the story of Lisa Mahone, who was pulled over by a police officer who she says was acting really weird. When he pulled a gun on her, Lisa decided to call 911 — on the cop. WBEZ has been covering this story since it happened in the fall. Here's their original story from October 2014 . (7 1/2 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
In 2008, the Milwaukee Police Department, which has a long history of tension with black residents, got a new chief named Ed Flynn. One of his big goals when he came to the city was to try and improve the relationship between cops and black Milwaukeeans. Producer Brian Reed shadows some Milwaukee officers, to see what the department is trying. Brian also tells the story of Derek Williams, who died in police custody, and asks Chief Flynn why his officers ignored Williams even though he kept saying, &quot;I can't breathe.&quot; (20 minutes)

      <description>Ira Glass was never into William Burroughs. Then he heard this radio story that changed that.

Ira talks about the fact that he never much liked William Burroughs or his writing, just never got 
why Burroughs was this revered figure for some people. Then Ira heard a recent BBC documentary 
about Burroughs and finally understood. Ira says he's going to play the whole documentary on the 
show in honor of what would have been Burroughs 101st birthday this week.
(2 minutes)

Act One
Iggy Pop, the documentary's narrator, begins by listing some of the artists and artistic movements 
influenced by Burroughs: Bob Dylan, The Beatles, Steely Dan, Kurt Cobain, Lou Reed; punk, heavy 
metal. We hear from director John Waters on the impact on him of Burroughs' open homosexuality 
and frankness about sex. Others talk about Burroughs' heroin addiction and obsession with guns 
and weapons. Burroughs shot his wife to death in what he said was a terrible accident.

      <description>Can people’s expectations change whether a blind man can see?

NPR Science reporters Alix Spiegel and Lulu Miller explain to Ira Glass how they smuggled 
a rat into NPR headquarters in Washington, and ran an unscientific version of a famous 
experiment first done by Psychology Professor Robert Rosenthal. It showed how people’s 
thoughts about rats could affect their behavior. Another scientist, Carol Dweck, explains that 
it’s true for people too: expectations affect students, children, soldiers, in measurable ways.  
(6 minutes)
By Lulu Miller Alix Spiegel

Act One
Lulu tells the story of Daniel Kish, who’s blind, but can navigate the world by clicking with his tongue. This gives him so much information about what’s around him, he does all sorts of things most blind people don’t. Most famously, he rides a bike. We learn why he was raised so differently from the way most blind kids are brought up, and how the book The Making of Blind Men by Robert Scott changes everything for him. (25 minutes)

      <description>The story of a company—or maybe it's a movement?—that has hundreds of people posting enthusiastic videos about it online.

This American Life staffers Brian Reed and Bianca Giaever explain to Ira this thing they've found online called WakeUpNow . It's a company but they can't tell exactly what it does, and what its product is. Maybe it's a club? An organization? They find hundreds of enthusiastic videos people have made about it. (5 minutes)

Act One
Brian and Bianca go to a WakeUpNow conference to try to figure out what the company really is. WakeUpNow does something called &quot;network marketing,&quot; which Brian points out, is a very bland term for something completely mind-blowing. The company's Marketing Director Jordan Harris tells Brian and Bianca that what they saw at the conference was not a good measure of what the company is. We also hear from Robert L. Fitzpatrick, who researches network marketing and wrote a book called False Profits ; and Damien Lacks, who quit his job to do WakeUpNow. (31 minutes)

Act Two
Jacob Goldstein and David Kestenbaum of NPR's Planet Money tell the story of two guys who decided that the CEO of a small tool company was paid too much and wanted to wake people up to that fact - They wanted to cut the CEO's pay. The two people happened to be investors in the tool company. It turns out if you think CEOs are paid too much, it's guys like this with money to invest in stocks that you want on your side. Planet Money is a production of NPR News. (15 minutes)

      <description>There's no agreement about how teachers should discipline students. And there's evidence that some of the most popular punishments may harm kids.

When it comes to disciplining young people, teachers are winging it. We ask middle school teachers all over the country to walk us through how they get a kid to take his hat off. The book Ira mentions is called Building a Better Teacher by reporter Elizabeth Green; it’s eye-opening in a number of ways. (5 1/2 minutes)

Act Two
About 20 years ago, a group of educators launched one of the biggest recent experiments in

The idea was to create classrooms that are rigorous and strict.  We talk with a student named 
Rousseau Mieze, who grew up in a school like that and then became a teacher.

      <description>An unprecedented look inside one of the most powerful, secretive institutions in the country.

Ira introduces Carmen Segarra, a bank examiner for the Federal Reserve in New York who, in 2012, started secretly recording as she and her colleagues went about regulating one of the most powerful financial institutions in the country. This was during a time when the New York Fed was trying to become a stronger regulator, so that it wouldn't fail to miss another financial crisis like it did with the meltdown in 2008. As part of that effort to reform, the Fed had commissioned a highly confidential report, written by Columbia professor David Beim, that identified why the regulator failed in the years leading up to the crisis. Beim laid out specific recommendations for how the Fed could fix its problems. Carmen's recordings allow us to see if the Fed successfully heeded those recommendations more than two years later. What we hear is not reassuring.

Act One
ProPublica 's Jake Bernstein tells the story of Carmen's first months at the New York Fed, and how she came to start recording. And we hear the story of how the Fed examiners respond to an unusual, questionable deal that Goldman Sachs did — a deal that the top Fed guy stationed inside Goldman calls &quot;legal but shady.&quot;

      <description>School board disputes are pretty common, but not like this one.

Before the war in the East Ramapo, New York school district, there was a truce. Local school officials made a deal with their Hasidic and ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighbors: we'll leave you alone to teach your children in private yeshivas as you see fit as long as you allow our public school budget to pass. But the budget is funded by local property taxes, which everyone, including the local Hasidim, have to pay — even though their kids don't attend the schools that their money is paying for. What followed was one of the most volatile local political battles we've ever encountered. (4 1/2 minutes)
By Ben Calhoun

Act One
Producer Ben Calhoun talks about how the truce in East Ramapo fell apart, and plumbs the depths
of the neighbor-vs-neighbor political war that emerged. Also, we learn that it can, in fact, be a 
massive deal when you change lawyers — at least when you're a school board. 
(25 minutes)

Act Two
Ben Calhoun's story on the East Ramapo school district feud continues. We hear from a former 
member of the board. And a lawyer working for the school board screams the worst possible swear

Ira talks to Planet Money reporter Zoe Chace about the day she spent with an 11-year-old entrepreneur named Asia Newson, who has a company called SuperBusinessGirl .

that the teams exert so much control over their lives - they are so up in they business - that the 
cheerleaders deserve to be considered employees. Chana Joffe-Walt reports, and interviews

Host Alex Blumberg talks about New York City’s long-standing ban on ferrets. And how, after 
years of forbidding them, the city is now poised to lift the ban. You’d think ferret proponents —

Alex Blumberg takes us to an American classroom where students are reading a classic, The Education of Little Tree , by Forrest Carter.

The origins of the heartwarming tale of respect for nature and tolerance, are actually filled with hatred, racism and lies. (31 minutes) This story was produced by Joe Richman, Sarah Kate Kramer and Samara Freemark of Radio Diaries with help from Nellie Gilles, Deborah George, and Ben Shapiro. Here's the Radio Diaries podcast , where people can hear the original non-narrated version of this story.

      <description>Stories of people coming to terms with being in serious trouble.

Ira brings up a story that got a lot of attention last year, in the New York Times and also on a lot of morning news shows. A couple was sailing across the Pacific Ocean with their two small children, and after three weeks of sailing they signaled for help — which came in the form of four National Guardsmen and a navy vessel. All the coverage seemed to be asking the same question: Are these bad parents? The couple involved, Eric and Charlotte Kaufman, had been silent about what happened on their boat, until talking to Ira.
(6 minutes)

Producer Sean Cole heads to Toronto to see if it was true what he heard: that lots and lots of the 
bartenders who used to serve him drinks there were on coke at the time. Then Sean takes Ira 
through a catalogue of the various professions in which people tend to get high. (9 minutes)
By Sean Cole

Act One
Producer Alex Blumberg introduces us to Richard, a former executive at a big time marketing firm 
who smoked pot daily — sometimes at work. As it turns out, Alex is intimately familiar with how Richard's getting high kept him from focusing on the important things in his life. (16 minutes)
By Alex Blumberg

Act Two
Our listeners sent us 2,600 emails with their own getting high stories. Contributor Elna Baker read a ton of them (other staffers read the rest). Elna then interviewed several people who wrote in, and determined that the &quot;I Was So High&quot; story is a particularly difficult genre to get right. One listener comes through with flying, psychedelic colors — telling us about the time he took mushrooms before appearing as a contestant on The Price is Right . (7 minutes)
By Elna Baker Ira Glass

Act Three
Comedian Wyatt Cenac tells the story of the first time he ever tried marijuana. He didn't smoke it. He ate a pot brownie. He then managed to convince himself that he had now acquired adult onset Down Syndrome. (And no, that does not exist.) (6 minutes)
By Wyatt Cenac
Song:“Shrooms” by The Lonely Island

Act Four
Comedian Marc Maron, who's been off drugs for more than 15 years, says he still thinks it's okay to laugh at funny drug stories. And then he tells us one of the funniest we heard while putting this show together. (11 minutes)

      <description>We ask the people who work at a hospice facility some personal questions about death and dying.

When you're a preteen, you walk around every day with the knowledge that your body is about to change. You don’t know exactly when or how. All you know is that it will happen and you will come out the other side a different person. We hear from kids who are reluctantly facing puberty any minute now. (4 minutes)

      <description>A pedophile who has never acted on his impulses starts an online support group to help himself and others like him.

When we started putting together this week's show, we assumed we'd be using the phrase &quot;tarred and feathered&quot; as a metaphor for when someone is publicly shamed. We didn't think we'd find a story about someone being literally tarred and feathered, especially not recently. But then we heard about the story of Jock Nelson. Ira talks to Jon Ronson about what happened to Jock in 2007. (10 minutes)
By Jon Ronson

Act One
Gene Cooley had just suffered a huge tragedy, and he was trying to move on. But suddenly 
anonymous posters started saying horrible things about him on a website called Topix. The horrible 
things weren't true. But that didn't stop the people in Gene's small town — a town of just 600 people — from believing them.

By Ira Glass

Act One
Ira plays tape from an interview that he did more than 20 years ago, with the author Doris Lessing, about her novel The Fifth Child , which tells the story of a woman who gives birth to a goblin-like baby. The archival audio appears courtesy of National Public Radio, Inc. Then Ira's conversation with Cheryl, from the top of the show, continues.

      <description>Stories of people who are coming to terms with the places they call home.

Host Ira Glass tell the story of a city pride campaign in Calgary, Canada. He speaks with life-long Calgarian Ken Lima-Cuelho who explains how much people in the city loved the campaign — and the song at the center of it, &quot;Hello Calgary.&quot; Except, Ira, and the song's composer, Frank Gari , have some bad news for Ken. (8 minutes)

Act One
James Spring tells the story of the &quot;Caminata Nocturna&quot; — a simulated illegal border crossing run by a small town in Mexico. The event was recently criticized by conservative media as a training camp for illegal immigration. Spring explains that the Caminata Noctura actually caters to middle-class and upperclass Mexicans — people who would never attempt to sneak into the US. He also explains that the whole thing was actually created with hopes to keep people in Mexico, not send them away. James did a Spanish language version of this story for Radio Ambulante . (18 minutes)
By James Spring

Act Two
Seth Freed Wessler reports on people going the opposite direction over the US/Mexico border. 
Each year hundreds of thousands of people are deported from the US to Mexico — tens of 
thousands more choose to leave on their own — and lots of them make the journey after years and years living in the states. Wessler explains how customer service call centers in Mexico are capitalizing on the fact that many of these people speak English with American accents. They're hiring such people, and using them to staff customer service lines for American companies. But, for those who've left the US, taking calls over and over from the place they used to call home, it can be a complicated experience.

      <description>Last May, the FBI killed a guy in Florida who was loosely linked to the Boston Marathon bombings.

Ira explains that in May 2013, the FBI shot a guy named Ibragim Todashev in his living room in 
Florida. Supposedly, right before he died, Todashev implicated himself in a crime, a pretty 
gruesome one, a triple murder of three drug dealers in Waltham Massachusetts, a Boston suburb.  
Law enforcement officials told reporters that he also named one of the alleged Boston Marathon 
bombers – Tamerlan Tsarnaev – as his accomplice in the crime. And then, right before he signed 
a confession, he supposedly freaked out, and an FBI agent shot him. Which is weird in itself. But 
weirder still is the fact that the FBI has been silent about what happened. They first promised an 
investigation on this last May. And since then, we’ve heard that it’s coming, but nine months later it hasn’t arrived. So many questions remain: what happened during that interrogation that led to them shooting Ibragim Todashev? If they had such good evidence connecting him to these 
murders, why didn’t they just arrest him? What evidence did they have? How good is the evidence 
connecting the alleged Boston bomber to the murders? Do they truly know who committed the 
triple murders? In the absence of solid information, conspiracy theories sprang up. Some people 
started to believe the FBI was hiding something.  
(7 minutes)

Act One
Susan Zalkind spent six months investigating all this for Boston Magazine and This American Life . And she has a personal connection to the 2011 triple murder. She knew one of the three drug dealers who were killed: Erik Weissman was a friend of hers. In this half of the show, she explains what happened when she reached out to people who might have information on Ibragim Todashev, the man killed by the FBI in Florida. First his girlfriend Tatiana Gruzdeva and then his best friend Khusen Taramov are more or less kicked out of the country by federal authorities. Tatiana says she was told she was deported specifically because she spoke with Susan for a story. (17 minutes)
By Susan Zalkind

Act Two
Susan’s investigation continues, and she tells the story of a third person who was close to Ibragim Todashev who was whisked out of the United States after actions by the FBI. (20 minutes)

When Mike and Sara bought their first house, they didn’t have much money for furniture. So they

All over the United States there are ice storms and blizzards. Today we get away from all of that, first to sunny California. We hear from Sharon Jacobucci , who loves to work, and she’s got one of the stickiest jobs — she’s a parking attendant. But that’s no matter to her, because she works along Venice beach, where the weather is warm and the view is always great. (4 minutes)
Song:“King of the Beach” by Wavves

Act One

      <description>Stories about how it sucks to be in limbo, and a man who absolutely loves listening to hold music.

Rachel has two kids. Elias, age seven, is a vegetarian. Theo, age five, is not. But Elias wants Theo, and everyone else in the house, to be vegetarian too. So Rachel and her husband are in the middle of negotiating the desires of two very strong willed kids.

Act One
Sara Corbett 's father-in-law Dick is 81. And he's become obsessed with a limbo most of us hate – the music he hears whenever he's on hold. Sara is co-author of the book A House in the Sky . Here is the hold music, Opus No. 1 .
By Sara Corbett

Act Two
Mark Oppenheimer reports on agunah in the Orthodox Jewish community. An agunah is a woman whose husband refuses to give her a divorce – in Hebrew it means &quot;chained wife.&quot; If you're an Orthodox Jew, strictly following Jewish law, the only real way to get divorced is if your husband agrees to hand you a piece of paper called a get. Without the get, women who want out of their marriages can stay chained to their husbands for years. In New York, a couple of rabbis were recently accused of using violence to force men to give their wives a get. Mark writes the Beliefs column for The New York Times.

      <description>One car dealership tries to make its monthly quota: 129 cars. It is way more chaotic than we expected.

It’s mid-October, 2013. Freddie Hoyt tries to rally his sales staff to sell 129 cars and trucks by the end of the month. Freddie’s the General Manager at Town and Country Jeep Chrysler Dodge Ram in Levittown, NY, on Long Island. Problem is, the customers are not cooperating. (7 1/2 minutes)

Act One
How we found this car dealer. (2 minutes)

Act Two
A quick primer of who’s who, and how the place works. (6 minutes)

Act Three
Salesman Bob Tantillo has the fewest sales of anyone at Town and Country this month. Robyn Semien spoke to him. (4 minutes)
By Robyn Semien

Act Four
Salesman Jason Mascia has the most sales of anyone this month, as usual. Sean Cole spent a week with him watching how he does it. (8 minutes)
By Sean Cole

Act Five
The next-to-last day of the month. Deals fall apart, but not all of them. (10 minutes)

Act Six
The last day of the month begins. They have to sell nine cars by the end of the day. &quot;God help us,&quot; Freddie says. (2 minutes)

Act Seven
Joe Monti’s real name is Joe Montalbano. But when he started in the car business, he didn't want to lose a sale because a customer couldn’t keep his name straight so he simplified it for the job. He's one of the managers of the used cars department at Town and Country. Sarah Koenig reports on what it'll mean if he doesn’t make this month’s goal. (7 minutes)
By Sarah Koenig

Act Eight
The last day of the month continues and the truism is accurate: some people get great deals because it’s the end of the month and they have to hit their goal. When you look at the numbers, the average car they sell in the last two days actually loses money. (4 minutes)

Act Nine
Salesman Manny Rosales keeps to himself in the showroom, with his own sales philosophy. He explained it to Brian Reed. (7 minutes)

      <description>The history of racial housing discrimination in the United States and what has been done—and hasn't been done—to rectify it.

Ira talks to 15 year old Jada who, when she was in third grade, moved from Akron Public Schools in Ohio, to the nearby Copley-Fairlawn schools in the suburbs. After two years, Jada was kicked out by administrators who discovered that her mother was using Jada's grandfather's address in Copley, instead of her own in Akron. Jada says that while the schools are only a few miles apart, the difference in education was astounding. For more information about Jada and her mother, Kelley Williams Bolar, who spent 10 days in jail because she falsified documents so she could enroll Jada and her sister in the Copley-Fairlawn schools, you can go here . (5 minutes)

Huntington's Disease is a progressive brain disorder. There's a wide range of symptoms, but in the worst cases, people who have it can end up losing physical control of their bodies, sort of like Parkinson's Disease, and can also have mental symptoms that are like Alzheimer's or schizophrenia. If you have a parent with Huntington's Disease, you have a 50-50 chance of getting it. In this audio diary, a woman named Kelly has decided to get tested for the disease. Her mother has Huntington's and several of her family members have either been diagnosed, or are showing symptoms of the disease. Paige Cowett of WNYC produced Kelly's audio diary. The story is part of a project called “The Antidote.&quot; There's more information about &quot;The Antidote,&quot; and a video of Kelly and her niece Kayla, at the WNYC website . (12 minutes)

Ira talks to Father Thomas Santa about the kind of confession that he finds among the most difficult to listen to — and not because what’s being confessed is too big or too horrible — but because, as Father Santa explains, they aren’t sins at all. (10 minutes)

Act One
Former DC police detective Jim Trainum tells reporter Saul Elbein about how his first murder investigation went horribly wrong.

      <description>More than 150 Americans die each year on average after accidentally taking too much acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol.

Host Ira Glass tells the story of Sarah Erush, a pharmacist at the Hospital of the University of 
Pennsylvania.  She was contacted by the Food and Drug Administration and encouraged to 
examine cases of acetaminophen overdose at her hospital. Erush was surprised by how 
little over the recommended dose of the drug resulted in liver damage and, for three 
patients, death.  (10 minutes)

Act One
Reporter Sean Cole tells the history of getting warning labels onto acetaminophen bottles. In 1977 an FDA advisory panel recommended a warning about liver damage. It took 32 years before the FDA took their advice and mandated a label. As Cole notes: &quot;The drug approval process is usually slow but not usually this slow. The FDA began with acetaminophen over 40 years ago in 1972. In that time, science has mapped the human genome, eradicated smallpox, we’ve cloned a sheep. And yet we still have not come up with final rules for safe usage and labeling of one of the most popular drugs in the country, of which more than 20 billion doses are sold each year.&quot; (24 minutes)

      <description>How a stolen library book got one man into his dream school and changed his life forever. Or at least that's the story he tells himself.

Students all over are starting college this month, and some of them still have a nagging question: what, exactly, got me in? An admissions officer talks about the most wrongheaded things applicants try. And Michael Lewis has the incredible story of how a stolen library book got one man into his dream school. (2 1/2 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Ira talks to Rick Clark, director of undergraduate admissions at the Georgia Institute of Technology, better known as Georgia Tech.

By Ira Glass

Act Two
Writer Michael Lewis tells the story of a man named Emir Kamenica, whose path to college 
started with fleeing the war in Bosnia and becoming a refugee in the United States. Then he 
had a stroke of luck: a student teacher read an essay he’d plagiarized from a book he’d 
stolen from a library back in Bosnia, and was so impressed that she got him out of a bad high 
school and into a much better one. He went on to Harvard and great success. Years later, he 
tracks down the student teacher to thank her, only to find that she remembers the story differently. (34 minutes)

      <description>Planet Money looks at a charity that's decided to just give people money.

Ira speaks with Sharon Snyder. Until recently, Sharon was a clerk for circuit court judge in Missouri. While she was at work, a man and a woman approached her looking for some paperwork so they could help out their brother, who was in prison for rape. The prisoner claimed he was innocent of the crime and had decided to file a motion for a DNA test. Sharon decided to help the man with the paperwork, which didn't please her employer.
(6 minutes)

Act One
Planet Money reporters David Kestenbaum and Jacob Goldstein went to Kenya to see the work of a charity called GiveDirectly in action. Instead of funding schools or wells or livestock, GiveDirectly has decided to just give money directly to the poor people who need it, and let them decide how to spend it. David and Jacob explain whether this method of charity works, and why some people think it's a terrible idea. (28 minutes)

Ira tells the story of Meron Estefanos , a freelance journalist who in 2011 got a troubling tip: A group of Eritrean hostages was being tortured and held for ransom in the Sinai desert. Along with the tip was a phone number. Meron dialed it, and soon dozens of desperate hostages were begging her for help. Their pleas were impossible for Meron to ignore: Soon she was talking to the hostages regularly and devoting her life to trying to save them. Today’s show includes excerpts from the harrowing phone calls she recorded with the hostages. (7 1/2 minutes)

Act One
Reporter Yowei Shaw tells the story of the first group of 28 captives that Meron spoke to, the obstacles she faced in trying to publicize their plight and her decision to try to raise ransom money to free them. (21 minutes)

      <description>An American woman suddenly trades her life for one in a place most people might think twice about: Juarez, Mexico.

An open letter — supposedly from the foreign media covering Nelson Mandela — to every man woman and child in South Africa. (Thanks to John Matisonn for sending it — it was written by journalist Richard Poplak .) (3 ½ minutes)

Act One
A recording of a very unusual conversation that came about in an unusual way. Filmmaker named Eugene Jarecki made a documentary about the drug war, prisons and the criminal justice system called The House I Live In .

Emily writes about her life there on the really great blog &quot;The Real Housewife of Ciudad Juarez.&quot; You can read some of her favorite posts here: “ 20% ,” “ Secondary Inspection ,” “ Sexico ,” “ Too Sad for Witty Titles ,” and “ How to Deal .” This story was produced by Ann Heppermann with assistance from Debbie Nathan.

      <description>The story of a guy named Kirk Johnson, who started a list of Iraqis who needed to get out of their country.

Ira talks with Producer Nancy Updike about when she first met Kirk Johnson in 2007. At the time 
he was mulling a crazy plan that involved Iraqi refugees, the Coast Guard and a boat. 
(5 minutes)
By Nancy Updike

Act One
Kirk sleepwalks through an open window and into a completely different life. He explains how he starts compiling a list of Iraqis who’d worked with the U.S. government after the invasion, whose lives were now in danger because of that. Carrying around that list gets some very strange reactions from government officials. Kirk is founder and executive director of The List Project to Resettle Iraqi Allies . His memoir To Be a Friend Is Fatal comes out in September. (23 minutes)

      <description>People who know something's a bad idea, but convince themselves to do that thing anyway.

Ira plays audio from a YouTube video made by Jonathan Perez. In it, 24 year old Jonathan, 
an undocumented immigrant, walks straight into a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
office, tells an officer he doesn’t have papers, and gets himself arrested. Why would anyone do 
that?
(8 minutes)

Act One
Reporter Michael May tells the story of activists from the National Immigrant Youth Alliance who intentionally got arrested for being undocumented. They believed if they could get inside the Broward Transitional Center in Florida, they could prevent lots of the immigrants there from being deported. Obama Administration policy, laid out in a series of documents called the Morton memos, states that non-violent immigrants who are not criminals are low priority for detention. Michael May also wrote a print version of this story, for The American Prospect . (27 minutes)
By Michael May

Act Two
Christine Gentry grew up in a house in Texas where there was one important rule above all others. It came from her dad: we have loaded guns in the house, and even though I’ve taught you how to shoot them, no one can ever touch them without me being there. As far as anyone in the family knew the kids grew up obeying that rule. Until this past December when Christine confesses to the one time when — as a teenager — that she broke the rule.

      <description>All of the stories in the show are things that have taken place in the last seven days.

Third and fourth graders from Polaris Charter Academy in Chicago get ready for an overnight camping trip. Before they set off, they review the rules: What to do if you see a bug; what to do if you have to go to the bathroom; and most important — what to do if you’re confronted with a crying friend. In Berwick, Pennsylvania, we drop in a town meeting, where Detective Greg Martin tells residents the tricks to spotting kids who might be cooking meth in their neighborhoods. Next to central California, where a juvenile prisoner named Jorge gets transferred to an adult prison, the very day he turns 18. And in St. Paul, Minnesota, real estate agent Sophia Thu Pham goes door to door, hoping people are game to sell their houses. (7 minutes)

Act One
News kept coming all week about the National Security Agency collecting data on the phone numbers we dial. Government officials are saying there’s nothing to be alarmed about. But it’s hard to know whether we should be alarmed anyway — since most of us don’t know what it feels like to have the government eavesdropping on our phone calls and emails. To find out, Ira talks to four attorneys for Guantanamo detainees, who know for sure they’re being spied on: Candace Gorman, David Nevin, Ramzi Kassem, and David Raimes. (8 minutes)

Act Two
Reporter Annie Correal hangs around with Sol Saltzman, a demolition guy who’s scrambling for bids around Oklahoma City, to help clean up damage from the recent tornados. It’s a cutthroat business, and Sol explains to Annie how he works all the angles. Annie’s reporting is part of series she’s doing on disaster migrants, with support from the French-American Foundation Immigration Journalism Fellowship . (8 minutes)
By Annie Correal

Act Three
Peter Lee had his arm amputated because of cancer three years ago. On Thursday of this week, he got a new, top-of-the-line prosthetic arm. During his final fitting, he talks to Rio Bennin, who also has a prosthetic arm — but Rio’s is an older model, not as nearly as fancy as Peter’s. (3 1/2 minutes)

Act Four
At Guantanamo Bay, hearings resumed for Abd al Rahim al Nashiri, who is accused of organizing the attack on the USS Cole, in 2000. This week was the first time reporters had been back to Guantanamo since President Obama gave a speech in which he said he’d renew efforts to close the prison. Meanwhile, a majority of the prisoners at Guantanamo are now on a hunger strike, and dozens of them are being force-fed. This American Life producer Sarah Koenig talks to reporter John Knefel about what it was like to be there. John reports on Guantanamo for rollingstone.com , and is co-host of the Internet radio show Radio Dispatch . (10 1/2 minutes)
By Sarah Koenig

Act Five
Science teacher Jason Pittman , who teaches pre-school through sixth grade at a school in Fairfax County, Virginia, won a big teaching award this week. In fact, during his ten years teaching, he’s won many, many awards. He loves his job. But this week, he explains to Ira why he’s quitting, even though he doesn’t want to. (6 minutes)

Act Six
On Wednesday, Florida executed a death row inmate named William Van Poyck . His execution came the same week that Florida’s governor signed a new law designed to speed up executions in the state. Emily Bazelon , legal affairs editor at Slate , explains that of all the states in the country, Florida is probably the last one where you’d want executions to move faster. (8 minutes)

      <description>Why people say our patent system may be discouraging, not encouraging, innovation.

Host Ira Glass and Zoe Chace from NPR’s Planet Money talk with Jim Logan and Richard Baker of Personal Audio , which claims it holds a patent used by all podcasters. Podcasters, they say, owe them money. Only catch: their company never made a digital podcast or invented a way to download it into a listening device. What they did, back in 1996: they patented the idea that such a thing can be done. Now they’ve asked podcasters to pay them licensing fees ... including Adam Carolla , Stuff You Should Know , Jesse Thorn and Marc Maron , who we hear from. Although Personal Audio says they aren’t asking for licenses from non-profits or public radio at this time, Maron’s and Thorn’s podcasts appear on public radio. (7 minutes)
By Planet Money

Act One
NPR reporter Laura Sydell and This American Life producer/ Planet Money co-host Alex Blumberg tell the story of Intellectual Ventures , which is accused of being the largest of the patent trolls. Executives at Intellectual Ventures insist they are not trolls, but rather, promoters of innovation. They buy patents from struggling inventors, which encourages those inventors to go out and invent more stuff. Intellectual Ventures offers an example of such an inventor, a man named Chris Crawford. But when Laura and Alex try and talk to Chris Crawford, it leads them on a long search, culminating in a small town in Texas, where they find a hallway full of seemingly empty offices with no employees.

      <description>Why has the conversation on climate change been stuck in the same place for years?

Host Ira Glass remembers Hurricane Sandy, and the feeling that we might be getting a preview of 
what the world would looking like as climate change continues. He talks about how stuck the 
country’s conversation about climate change has been, but how for the first time in a long time, it 
seems that might change. (2 minutes)

Act One
Reporter Julia Kumari Drapkin tells the story of Colorado’s State Climatologist, Nolan Doesken . Doesken has long believed that humans are driving climate change, but never connected it to his own life. Even after several years of some of the most devastating weather his state has ever seen, Nolan considered climate change a worry for the future. Then, last year, he watched as his state experienced some of the most extreme weather it ever has. For the first time, Nolan felt like he was looking at what the future would be like where he lives. He felt scared. Julia tells the story of how this has all changed Nolan, and changed what he’s saying to the people of his home state. Julia is the lead producer of iSeeChange at station KVNF, funded by Localore , AIR and CPB . (18 minutes)

Act Two
Producer Ben Calhoun tells the story of a former Congressional Representative from South Carolina, Bob Inglis . Inglis is a conservative Republican who once doubted climate science. After he looked at the research, he changed his mind, and decided to speak out. In 2010, he was mocked by people in his own party and trounced in by a Tea Party-backed candidate. Since then, Bob has dedicated himself to the issue even more — and he’s now trying to create a conservative coalition for climate change action. (15 minutes)

      <description>The startling rise of the number of people on disability in America.

Ira Glass talks with Planet Money reporter, Chana Joffe-Walt, about Hale County, Alabama — a place where one fourth of working age adults are on disability. That means the government has determined that due to a health issue, 25 percent of the adults in Hale County are unable to work, qualifying them for monthly payments and health care coverage. Chana explains that people in Hale County have a lot of theories as to why their disability numbers are so high: freeloaders, cheaters, hard partiers, obesity. But none of those seem quite right. The rise in disability isn't just happening in Hale County but in pockets all over the country. 14 million people are now receiving disability payments. And it's a number that is growing. We devote the whole show today to figuring out why these numbers are ballooning and what it says about our economy. (7 minutes)
By Chana Joffe-Walt

Act One
Chana Joffe-Walt spent six months reporting on the rise in people on disability. She spends time in Hale County, Alabama, talking to the only general practitioner in town, the main person who okays so many of the county's residents for disability. In addition to giving each patient a medical exam, the doctor also asks this question: what grade did you finish? Chana explains why that one question is so central to the whole story. (22 minutes)

      <description>We asked listeners to send us their best coincidence stories, and we got more than 1,300 submissions!

Hannah Jacoby tells the story of when she and her best friend Lindsey bonded over those toy soldiers with the parachutes, called (really) Poopatroopers — and how the little jumpers perfectly bookended their high-school years. And guest host Sarah Koenig explains the very interesting trends we discovered in our listeners' coincidences. (9 minutes)
By Sarah Koenig

Act One
A surprising number of coincidences involve grandmothers — that’s one of the things we learned doing this show. One grandma has so many coincidences happen to her, it drives her granddaughter, 16-year-old Juliana Bontrager, to try to beat her at her own coincidence game. And we also hear from Blake Oliver about a very strange appearance his grandma once made. You can hear more from Blake Oliver in an interview on The Story . (9 minutes)

Act Two
When it comes to love, coincidences tend to loom extra-large. Stephen Lee tells about the time his parents first met his fiance’s parents, and his future mother-in-law dropped a coincidence bomb. And we hear how a dollar bill ended up clinching a marriage, after floating around Chicago for years. (10 minutes)
Song:“Someplace I’m Supposed to Be” by Bry Webb with Rich Burnett

Act Three
Ryan Rozar told us about a confounding coincidence that was visited on him in college. We didn’t think it was a coincidence at all, so we set out to prove him wrong. (8 minutes)

Act Four
More stories of dazzling coincidences: an old boyfriend is conjured in Morocco, a jazz singer seems to rise from the dead, and three boys believe they’ve seen a corpse. Plus stories of errant fathers, lost and found. (13 minutes)

      <description>Part two of our program on Harper High School in Chicago, where in the last year 29 current and recent students were shot.

Principal Leonetta Sanders is worried that in the wake of a recent shooting, some of her students at Harper might be in danger of retaliatory violence. The threat is so real, she's considering canceling the school's Homecoming football game and dance. The possibility of canceling is heartbreaking to her, though, as all she wants is to give her students one normal high school dance. On Homecoming day, she gathers her staff to announce that there has been word of more shooting in the neighborhood. (5 minutes)

Act One
Most murders in Chicago happen in public places — parks, alleyways, cars. Scores of Harper students will tell you they've actually seen someone shot. Reporter Alex Kotlowitz talks with a junior named Thomas, who has seen more than his fair share. Thomas meets with his social worker, Anita Stewart, and tries to explain what it feels like to hold all of these images — and feelings — inside of him. He worries he can't hold on to them much longer. (10 minutes)
By Alex Kotlowitz

Act Two
Reporter Ben Calhoun tells the story of Terrance Green, a 16-year-old who was killed three years ago but is still an iconic presence at Harper.  Ben asks Terrance's dad and his best friend: Why did this one kid's death lead to slickly produced songs, tribute videos, a gang in his name, assault rifles on the street and an entire remapping of the violence in the area around Harper High School?  
(15 minutes)
By Ben Calhoun

Act Three
Chicago has strict gun laws but, obviously, teenagers are somehow getting their hands on guns. Lots of guns. We've all heard about straw purchasers and gun shows but 15-year-olds aren't spending hundreds of dollars to buy guns, or exploiting gun show loopholes. Reporter Linda Lutton gathers together a group of Harper boys and asks them: where do you get your guns? They tell her not only where they get them, but where they keep them, too. (6 minutes)
By Linda Lutton

Act Four
In the first hour of our Harper High School shows, Alex Kotlowitz talked to a junior named Devonte who a year earlier had accidentally shot and killed his 14-year-old brother. Devonte was forming a strong relationship with Crystal Smith, one of the social workers, and beginning to come to terms with both his grief and guilt. Alex checks back in with Devonte and finds out that his life has taken some troubling turns. (8 minutes)
By Alex Kotlowitz

Act Five
Late in the semester, Principal Sanders takes a look at her budget. It doesn't look good. She talks with Ben Calhoun about what is going to change — and who won't be at Harper — next year. (7 minutes) Update 4/2013: First Lady Michelle Obama to visit Harper High School Update 7/2013: Harper Student Murdered

      <description>We spent five months at a high school in Chicago where in the last year 29 current and recent students were shot.

At the first day assembly, the freshman seem confused and nervous while the seniors are boisterous and confident. It's exactly the kind of first day stuff you'd expect at any school. Until Harper Principal Leonetta Sanders calls for a moment of silence to honor the students Harper has lost in the last year. Then Harper doesn't seem so ordinary. In the clean and orderly halls of Harper, we meet the staff as they shepherd the students through new schedules and rules while they also try to reassure parents about the frightening rise in shootings in the neighborhood. (7 minutes)

Act One
So many of the shootings in the Englewood neighborhood of Chicago, the neighborhood where Harper High sits, are characterized as &quot;gang-related.&quot; Often, the implication is that gang-related means there is a reason to the shooting — huge, established gangs shooting it out over drug territory. Gang-related often implies you must've deserved it, a certain level of 'what goes around comes around.' Reporter Linda Lutton talks to dozens of Harper students who say adults don't understand that that's not the way it works. Gangs don't operate the way they used to. (13 minutes)
By Linda Lutton

Act Two
Reporter Alex Kotlowitz spends time in the social work office, where the effects of gun violence are most often apparent. Early on in the year, social worker Crystal Smith spends time with a junior named Devonte, talking him through his grief and guilt after Devonte accidentally shot and killed his 14 year old brother last year. Crystal also meets with Devonte's mother, who has some understandably confused feelings towards Devonte. (16 minutes)

      <description>A couple decides to sleep with other people before they tie the knot. Plus, more stories of love making us do crazy things.

David Kestenbaum tells Ira about the time, when he was doing graduate work in physics, he and his other single friends decided to figure out the mathematical probability that they’d find girlfriends. They wanted to know what the chances were that there was more than one person in the world for them. When you’re in love, it always feels like it was meant to be, whether or not it really, statistically speaking, is. (6 1/2 minutes)
By David Kestenbaum

Act One
Kurt Braunohler and his girlfriend had been together for thirteen years, and they were only 30.

      <description>We got a tip about a meat plant selling pig intestines as fake calamari and decided to investigate.

Prologue
Fred Armisen worked up an imitation of Ira and put it into a sketch on Saturday Night Live a couple of years ago. But when they rehearsed it with an audience, there was not a roar of recognition; it seemed like Ira might not be famous enough to be mocked on network TV. Armisen finally gets a go as Ira’s doppelgänger in our studios by co-hosting this episode. (4 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Ben Calhoun tells a story of physical resemblance — not of a person, but of food. A while ago, a farmer walked through a pork processing plant in Oklahoma with a friend who managed it. He came across boxes stacked on the floor with labels that said &quot;artificial calamari.&quot; So he asked his friend &quot;What’s artificial calamari?&quot; &quot;Bung,&quot; his friend replied. &quot;Hog rectum.&quot; Have you or I eaten bung dressed up as seafood? Ben investigated. (26 minutes) Extra: Pig/squid shirts and prints .

      <description>A perfectly normal guy gets rid of everything he owns, changes his name, says goodbye to his friends—and begins walking.

Julia Lurie is an American teaching English at an all-girls high school in Gwangju, a city in South 
Korea. When she first got there, some things struck her as strange: On every floor of the school there was a full-length mirror, as well as a scale. And the girls used them constantly. They seemed openly preoccupied by their looks and their weight. South Korea, she finds out, has the highest per capita rate of plastic surgery in the world — some of her students had already had plastic surgery, and more were planning to get it. Julia tells what happened when she decided to teach a lesson on &quot;beauty&quot; to her students.

He gives away everything he owns and all his money, and sets off from Delaware. He lasts three days. Elna never knew what had happened, so recently she met up with Daryl and got him to tell the story. Elna is the author of a memoir, The New York Regional Mormon Singles Halloween Dance . Daryl's newest play is &quot;Unbound.&quot; In February there will be a reading of Daryl's newest play, &quot;Unbound,&quot; at the IAMA Theatre Company in Los Angeles. (21 minutes)

      <description>People reach out in all kinds of ways to try to get their point across—messages in code, over the phone, and from beyond the grave.

Reporter Josh Bearman tells Ira a story about two coded messages that Galileo sent to fellow scientist Johannes Kepler back in the 17th century. Galileo was trying to tell Kepler about some of the amazing discoveries he made with his new telescope. And after months of mind-bending work, Kepler finally decoded the messages.  Eureka! There was only one catch. Kepler was wrong. But he was also kind of right. But also, still, kind of wrong.

      <description>A growing body of research that suggests we may be on the verge of a new approach to some of the biggest challenges facing American schools.

Host Ira Glass talks about his experiences reporting on education and the
unending question of how we can make schools better.  He discusses the
Chicago Teachers strike and an essay by writer Alex Kotlowitz that talks
about how the strike raises questions about the severity of this challenge. (4 1/2 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Ira talks with Paul Tough, author of the book How Children Succeed , about the traditional ways we measure ability and intelligence in American schools. They talk about the focus on cognitive abilities and conventional &quot;book smarts.&quot; They discuss the current emphasis on these kinds of skills in American education, and the emphasis on standardized testing, and then turn our attention to a growing body of research that suggests we may be on the verge of a new approach to some of the biggest challenges facing American schools today. Paul Tough discusses how “non-cognitive skills” — qualities like tenacity, resilience, impulse control — are being viewed as increasingly vital in education, and Ira speaks with economist James Heckman, who’s been at the center of this research and this shift. (38 1/2 minutes)

      <description>An estate attorney discovers a financial scheme that's all reward and no risk. The only catch? You have to die to get the money.

Ira talks with UC Davis Professor Kathy Stuart about a macabre trend that dates back to 17th and 18th century Europe. It seems that in order to avoid eternal damnation for the sin of committing suicide, a number of people began committing murder for the express purpose of turning themselves in, confessing their sins to a priest in order to be blessed and forgiven before being executed.

David Rakoff died on August 9, 2012. He’d appeared on This American Life 25 times, first in 1996, during the third month of the show; his last appearance was just a few weeks before he died.

But his behavior was so odd that Monteilh himself came under suspicion. Documentary filmmaker Sam Black reports the story. (25 minutes)

      <description>It used to be that the American expats in China were the big shots. But that's changed.

In preparing for this show, we started reaching out to Americans living in China and asking for their stories.  A shocking amount of the expats came back with stories about different times they were on Chinese television.  So many people sent us their China TV stories that we began to wonder, &quot;have ALL of you guys been on TV?!  Is this the consummate expat
experience in China?&quot; Several expats talk to Ira about why the Chinese love foreigners on their TV shows. And Evan Osnos, a staff writer for The New Yorker who writes about China, says it's hard for Americans living in China to figure out what to tell friends and family back home.
(7 1/2 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
There are about seventy thousand Americans living in mainland China today, according to the Chinese and US governments. A lot of the Americans in China only stay for a few years, but then there are others — American ex-pats who’ve lived in China for a decade or more with no foreseeable plans to come home. Who are they? And how Chinese do they become? Evan Osnos has this story, which starts with an ex-pat named Kaiser Kuo. Evan is a staff writer at The New Yorker and author of the book Age of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth, and Faith in the New China . (29 minutes)

      <description>Religion makes clear the difference between mortal sins and venial ones. But in our everyday lives, it can be really difficult to determine just how bad we've been.

Host Ira Glass plays tape from a political rally in support of a Chicago politician named Derrick Smith, who had just been arrested for accepting a bribe. His supporters likely believed that Smith had erred...but they also believed that the other candidate was even worse. Then Ira speaks with a Franciscan priest named Father Augustino Torres, to help clarify what separates serious sins — the mortal ones — from the not so serious, venial sins.
(9 minutes)

Act One
Producer Alex Blumberg tells the story of Jeff Smith, a former Missouri State Senator who spent last year in federal prison. The story of how Jeff ended up there includes large sins, but begins with a relatively small one. In other words, it's the story of a venial sin turning into a mortal one. Alex can regularly be heard on Planet Money , which is a collaboration between NPR News and This American Life . (33 1/2 minutes)
By Alex Blumberg

Act Two
Lying is a sin. But what about the lies that we all collectively believe because they give us hope? Jonathan Goldstein tells this story about confronting the truth. It's based on one of Aesop's fables. Jonthan hosts Wiretap on CBC Radio, and is author of Ladies and Gentlemen: The Bible . (5 minutes)

Act One
For a generation of baseball fans, when a pitcher suddenly stops being able to perform, it's known as &quot;Steve Blass Disease&quot; — after an all-star pitcher who inexplicably stopped being able to throw strikes. Ira Glass speaks with Steve Blass and others about this phenomenon. Blass is publishing an autobiography (with co-author Erik Sherman) called A Pirate For Life on May 1.

      <description>Discovering just how much time members of Congress spend raising money.

Host Ira Glass plays a voicemail containing something very common but very
rare to hear: an elected official directly asking a lobbyist for money.
(4 minutes).
By Ira Glass

Act One
Planet Money 's Alex Blumberg and NPR Congressional correspondent Andrea Seabrook take a tour through the world of money and politics, discovering just how much time members of Congress spend raising money and which committee assignments yield the biggest campaign donations.

By Alex Blumberg Andrea Seabrook

Act Two
Everything about political fundraising is changing right now, because of the 2010 Supreme Court decision in Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission. Since then, &quot;Super PACs&quot; have been able to funnel huge amounts of anonymous money into races. Producer Ben Calhoun shares the example of Ami Bera, whose run for Congress was dramatically affected by money from a Super PAC. (15 minutes).

      <description>We've discovered that one of our most popular episodes contained numerous fabrications. This week, we detail the errors in Mike Daisey's story about visiting Foxconn, which makes iPads and other products for Apple in China. Marketplace's China correspondent Rob Schmitz discovered the fabrications. Transcript. Press Release.

Host Ira Glass tells listeners we can no longer stand behind the reporting in the recently aired episode &quot; Mr. Daisey Goes to the Apple Factory .&quot; He explains how Marketplace reporter Rob Schmitz tracked down Daisey's interpreter in China — a woman named Cathy Lee — who disputes much of Daisey's story. And Ira talks about how Mike Daisey lied to TAL during the fact-checking process, telling Ira and our producers that Cathy was not her real name and that she was unreachable. Ira also stresses that, without Cathy's corroboration of the story, This American Life never should have run the story in the first place. (5 minutes).
By Ira Glass

Act One
Rob Schmitz , a Shanghai-based reporter for Marketplace , tracks down and interviews Cathy Lee, Mike Daisey's interpreter on his trip to Shenzhen, China, and the Foxconn factory. In her interview with Rob, Cathy disputes much of what Daisey has been telling theater audiences since 2010 and much of what he said on the radio. Rob also talks to Mike Daisey about Cathy's version of the trip and tries to square the two accounts. (21 minutes).
By Rob Schmitz

Act Two
Host Ira Glass has a lot of questions for Mike Daisey, beginning with why Daisey lied to Ira and This American Life producer Brian Reed about how they could fact-check his story with Cathy Lee.  Ira also explains This American Life 's fact-checking process, in general. (15 minutes).

      <description>Alabama's new immigration law aims to make life so difficult for illegal immigrants that they will &quot;self-deport.&quot;

Ira plays tape of a man whose job is plowing snow. He'll plow your driveway for money...or, if you're extra nice, he'll do it for free without even mentioning it. And if you're a jerk, well, he's got an answer for that too. He was interviewed by producer Jonathan Menjivar.
(3 1/2 minutes)
By Jonathan Menjivar

Act One
Last Summer, Alabama passed HB56, the most sweeping immigration bill in the country. It's an example of a strategy called &quot;attrition through enforcement&quot; or, more colloquially, &quot;self-deportation&quot;--making life so hard on undocumented immigrants that they choose to leave the country. But as reporter Jack Hitt found, the new law has had lots of other unintended
consequences. Jack has a book coming out this Spring called Bunch of Amateurs. (35 minutes)

      <description>The story of the European debt crisis is actually very surprising and dramatic.

Ira Glass asks guest host Alex Blumberg whether we should really care about the current European debt crisis. The answer: yes, we should, and we should WANT to care too, because this story—and it's actually the story of the Euro itself—is very surprising and dramatic. This hour, Alex and the Planet Money team helm the show. (3 minutes)
By Alex Blumberg Chana Joffe-Walt Planet Money

Act One
Planet Money reporters Chana Joffe-Walt and Zoe Chace tells the story of the far-fetched, 150 year-old dream of a universal European currency.
(13 1/2 minutes)

Act Two
When the Euro arrived in 2002, the BBC called it &quot;the most ambitious
financial and political change since money began.&quot; Here in the US we don't
think of it as that revolutionary, but in Europe it truly changed how
millions of people lived. Adam Davidson and Chana Joffe-Walt report.
(22 1/2 minutes)

Act Three
Adam and Chana tell how things turned dramatically worse for the Euro in
2009, when the new government in Greece announced that its national deficit
was twice what the previous government had reported.
(6 1/2 minutes)

Act Four
Chana and Alex tell what happened next, when technocrats in Germany and
other solvent European countries tried to fix the crisis by actually
enforcing the original rules for Euro Zone membership. It turned out that
even determining the real deficit in Greece was no easy task.

Ira Glass talks with Scharlette Holdman, who works with defense teams on high profile death row cases, and who has not talked to a reporter in more than 25 years. Why did she suddenly end the moratorium on press? Because her story is about something important: Namely, a beautiful chicken.
(2 1/2 minutes)

The number of wild turkeys in the United States has risen from 30,000 at the

turkey, named Tom, on Martha's Vinyard in 2008. Sam Bungey tells the story.

Here are the first , the second and the third . He went to the game worrying that Joe Paterno and the team are so embedded into his childhood memories and experiences, that the recent news will actually rip at his own feelings about his past. Sarah also talks with other State College residents who are struggling to make sense of the news. (21 minutes)

      <description>An orchestra teacher has a theory that he could kill cancer cells with electromagnetic waves.

Host Ira Glass talks with science writer Paul Hoffman about a mathematician named Frank Nelson Cole, who demonstrated a groundbreaking idea at a conference in 1903. Paul explains that in addition to their celebrated breakthroughs, many of the greatest thinkers in history have entertained some very crazy ideas. Paul is the author of many books including The Man Who Loved Only Numbers , and is director of the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey. (7 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
One day a successful cancer researcher named Jonathan Brody gave a talk at his alma mater, about how people in his field need to think outside the box if they're going to find a cure. Afterward Jonathan's old music teacher Anthony Holland shared an idea that was way out of the box: Killing cancer cells with electromagnetic waves. Gabriel Rhodes tells what happened next. Gabriel is also working on a documentary film version of this story, called The Cure . (35 minutes) Correction : Ira writes—In an edit of Gabriel Rhodes's story, I mistakenly asked him to insert erroneous information about sound waves and electromagnetic waves, and then acted so completely confident about it—misremembering a science show I worked on years ago—that nobody in the editing process bothered to fact check it. The people in the story were using electromagnetic waves, not sound waves, for their experiment. This was very much my mistake and not Gabe's, and I regret telling him to insert a mistake into his otherwise carefully researched and fact checked story. Thanks to the many listeners who wrote to point out the error. We've gone back and fixed this, so the versions aired in 2012 and posted here on the website have the correction.

      <description>Stories from the awkward, confusing, hormonally charged world of middle school.

Host Ira Glass interviews a 14-year old named Annie, who emailed us asking if we would do a show about middle school. She explains why exactly the middle school years can be so daunting. (4 1/2 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
In an effort to understand the physical and emotional changes middle school kids experience, Ira speaks with reporter Linda Perlstein , who wrote a book called Not Much Just Chillin' about a year she spent following five middle schoolers. Then we hear from producer Alex Blumberg, who was a middle school teacher in Chicago for four years before getting into radio. Alex's takeaway? We shouldn't even try teaching kids at this age. Marion Strok, principal of a successful Chicago school, disagrees. (6 1/2 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act Two
We sent several correspondents straight to the epicenters of middle school awkwardness: School dances. Producers Lisa Pollak and Brian Reed, plus reporters Eric Mennel, Rob Wildeboer and Claire Holman spoke with kids across the country during the nervous moments leading up to the dances. And Lisa even ventured inside, to the dance itself.
(9 1/2 minutes)
By Ira Glass Lisa Pollak

Act Three
When Domingo Martinez was growing up in a Mexican-American family in Texas, Domingo's two middle school aged sisters found a unique way of coping with feelings of inferiority. This story comes from Martinez's memoir The Boy Kings of Texas . (11 1/2 minutes)
By Domingo Martinez

Act Four
We realized that there are already reporters on the ground, embedded inside middle schools: The kids who report the daily announcements, sometimes on video with full newscast sets. Producer Jonathan Menjivar wondered what would happen if instead of announcing sports scores and the daily cafeteria menu, the kids reported what's really on their minds. Students at Parkville Middle School outside Baltimore, and their journalism teacher Ms. Davis, agreed to try out this experiment. (7 1/2 minutes)
By Jonathan Menjivar

Act Five
Producer Sarah Koenig reports on a kid we'll call Leo, whose family moved away from Rochester, NY, leaving behind all of Leo's friends and
stranding him in a new — and in his opinion, much worse — middle school.

      <description>We return to people who have been on the show in the last ten years, and whose lives were drastically altered by 9/11.

Host Ira Glass talks to someone who escaped from the twin towers with a minute to spare and someone who lost her husband on 9/11. Both say they try to avoid 9/11 commemorations. If that's true, then who are they for? (3 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Hyder Akbar was a teenager living with his family in the Bay Area when president Hamid Karzai asked Hyder's dad to return to Afghanistan and become an official in the new government. Hyder recorded audio diaries that became two episodes of our show, in 2002 and 2003 , both produced by Susan Burton . They also wrote a book . Ira checks in with Hyder, who is now an adult living and working in Afghanistan. (18 minutes)
By Susan Burton

Act Two
Marian Fontana, whose husband was a firefighter who died on 9/11, originally appeared on our show in 2005 . Ira talks with Marian today, about what has changed for her over the last 10 years. Marian wrote a book called A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11 , and is at work on a new book. (10 1/2 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act Three
In 2008 , reporter Chris Neary told the story of John, a soldier who returned from tours of Iraq and Afghanistan with severe PTSD, and ended up attacking his fiancee and her mother. Chris finds out how John is coping today. (6 1/2 minutes)
By Chris Neary

Act Four
The podcast and stream versions of the show include a story here that is not included in broadcast. It catches us up with an Iraqi translator named Basim, who fled the country to Norway after his life was threatened because he aided the American forces. The original ran in 2007 .
By Ira Glass

Act Five
Alix Spiegel revisits a story she reported in 2006 - which caused more listeners to email us than any other story we've broadcast. It was about a Muslim American girl named &quot;Chloe,&quot; who was tormented at school after the students had a lesson on 9/11. Alix is a correspondent for NPR News. (10 minutes) A Correction: In this story, we accidentally misreported a statistic. We stated that according to FBI statistics, about 10 percent of hate crimes in 2009 were against Muslims. In fact, about 10 percent of religiously-motivated hate crimes were against Muslims. It was 128 of the 1,376 religiously-motivated hate crimes that year (9.3 percent). In all, there were 7,789 hate crime offenses in 2009, so incidents against Muslims were 1.6% of the total, which is tiny. That same year, there were 2,724 hate crimes against Black people, 798 hate crimes against gay men and 964 hate crimes against Jews, according to the FBI. A table of the data is here on the FBI's website. Our reporter misread this summary . We're grateful to the listener who emailed and pointed this out, Robert Ben Garant.

      <description>A sociologist collects journals filled with gossip about AIDS in Malawi.

Senior producer Julie Snyder and her husband Jeff talk to guest host Sarah Koenig about gossip that takes place—where else?—in a beauty salon.
(8 minutes)
By Sarah Koenig

Act One
In Malawi, in southeast Africa, not gossiping can be worse than gossiping. Sarah interviews a young Malawian woman named Hazel Namandingo, who explains that because so many people have HIV and AIDS in Malawi, they often rely on gossip to figure out who's safe to date or marry. It turns out this kind of gossip is the basis for a huge research project about AIDS in Malawi. For 10 years, a sociologist named Susan Watkins has been collecting journals filled with gossip about AIDS. Watkins hired local people to write the journals—to just listen to what people were saying in their communities about the virus, and then write it down. What Watkins learned from reading them bucked much of the conventional wisdom about how rural Africans were dealing with the epidemic. (Plus, they're really entertaining.) There's a U Penn website that explains the Malawi Journals Project. And an NGO in Malawi called Invest in Knowledge has catalogued the journals. (30 minutes)

      <description>We head to some of the happiest places on earth: amusement parks!

Prologue
Host Ira Glass walks through a Kansas City Missouri amusement park called Worlds of Fun with Cole Lindbergh, who had a season pass to the park as a little kid, starting working there summers at 14, and then just stayed. Now he's a full-time, year-round employee, running the games department. It's possible he does this job better than anyone in the country. It's rare to witness someone so happily great at his job. (9 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Ira continues with Cole Lindbergh and the hundred teenagers who work for him
in the games department at Worlds of Fun.  We watch them compete against
each other to see who can do the most business, in Cole's Sweet Sixteen
bracket tournament, which pits all 32 games in the park against each other.
We hear about all the things Cole does that other games managers don't.  He
invents games. He directs music videos starring his team.  (23 minutes) Cole's Worlds of Fun videos mentioned in Act One: Play My Games Music Video I'm in a Game Music Video (The sequel: note how it starts where Play My Games ends) Training Video Sci Fi Special Effects Film (Yes, there's a two minute credit sequence/prologue before the action
starts) Others!
By Ira Glass

Act Two
We asked for your stories about amusement parks.  Three hundred of you
called in, with stories of fear, floating carnies and, um, vomit.  (9

      <description>Why would a company rent an office in a tiny town in East Texas, put a nameplate on the door, and leave it completely empty for a year?

There's a derogatory term in Silicon Valley for companies that amass huge troves of patents and make money by threatening lawsuits: &quot;patent trolls.&quot;  When Jeff Kelling's Internet company Fototime was sued - along with more than 130 other companies - for violating someone's patent, he wondered if it was a troll (which the company denies), and then settled out of court. (8 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
NPR reporter Laura Sydell and This American Life producer/ Planet Money co-host Alex Blumberg tell the story of Intellectual Ventures , which is accused of being the largest of the patent trolls. The investigation takes them to a small town in Texas, where they find a hallway full of empty companies with no employees. (29 minutes)

      <description>Two professors each make a calculation that no one had made before.

Host Ira Glass tells the stories of two professors, each making a calculation that no one had made before.  One gets acclaim.  One ends up out of a job.  The first, Terry Engelder, a geologist at Penn State, was estimating the amount of natural gas that's recoverable from the Marcellus shale, a giant rock formation that's under Pennsylvania and several other Eastern states.  The
second, Conrad &quot;Dan&quot; Volz, at the University of Pittsburgh, estimated how much toxic crap—chemicals and pollution from gas exploration—might be getting into water supplies. (6 1/2 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Producer Sarah Koenig continues the story Terry Engelder and Dan Volz, their rival calculations about natural gas in Pennsylvania, and how each was treated by his university. She explains how Pennsylvania's universities, politicans and industry have united to develop natural gas.  Other states have been more cautious.  (26 1/2 minutes)

      <description>The story of an entire country deciding whether to give up on just one of its citizens.

Host Ira Glass speaks with Jim McManus, whose book Positively Fifth Street inspired Ira to start playing poker. Jim talks about holding and folding, why a poker novice is sometimes the toughest player to beat...and the Cuban Missile Crisis. (8 1/2 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
David Ellis Dickerson tells the story of heading home to Tucson after six years away, having rejected the evangelical Christianity of his family. David came prepared for war, armed with new beliefs. But his family had something else in mind. David is author of the memoir House of Cards . (11 1/2 minutes)

By Nancy Updike

Act Three
One of the principles of treating alcoholism is that there's hope for everyone. You never fold your cards. But there are also places known as &quot;wet houses,&quot; controversial shelters for alcoholics where they are allowed to keep drinking. Reporter Marc Sanchez visited St. Anthony House, a wet house in St. Paul, to learn how it works. Marc is a producer at Minnesota Public Radio , where he works on a feature called &quot; Minnesota Sounds .&quot; (10 1/2 minutes)

      <description>Stories of people pretending that everything is okay and ignoring the awful stuff that's staring them straight in the face.

Ira speaks with Middle East specialist Michelle Dunne to answer this question: Before the recent Arab uprisings, just how hard was the US pushing the government of Egypt to enact human rights reforms? (7 1/2 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
When he was a kid, Josh Martin's mother Nancy told him that if anything
ever happened to her, he needed to take care of his brother Ben. This confused
Josh, because Ben was his older brother, and he felt that if anything he
should be the one taken care of. And years later, when something did happen to
Nancy, following through on that request ended up being more complicated
than Josh - and his other brother Matthew - could ever have imagined.
Producer Lisa Pollak tells the story. (23 1/2 minutes)
By Lisa Pollak

Act Two
In the wake of the tsunami and nuclear disaster at Fukushima, some people suspected that Japanese government officials have not been forthcoming about the actual level of danger from radiation. No one, however, is suggesting a cover-up as extreme as what happened in the Soviet Union after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster. A book called Voices from Chernobyl , written by Svetlana Alexievich and translated by Keith Gessin, has unusually poignant interviews with people impacted by the disaster. Actors Sarah Mollo-Christensen and Kelly Coffield Park read excerpts. (13 1/2 minutes)

      <description>A drug court program in Georgia where people with offenses that would get minimal or no sentences elsewhere sometimes end up in the system five to ten years.


Act One
Ira reports from Glynn County Georgia on Superior Court Judge Amanda
Williams and how she runs the drug courts in Glynn, Camden and Wayne
counties.  We hear the story of Lindsey Dills, who forges two checks on her
parents' checking account when she's 17, one for $40 and one for $60, and
ends up in drug court for five and a half years, including 14 months behind
bars, and then she serves another five years after that—six months of it
in Arrendale State Prison, the other four and a half on probation.  The
average drug court program in the U.S. lasts 15 months.  But one main way
that Judge Williams' drug court is different from most is how punitive it
is.  Such long jail sentences are contrary to the philosophy of drug court,
as well as the guidelines of the National Association of Drug Court
Professionals.  For violating drug court rules, Lindsey not only does jail
terms of 51 days, 90 days and 104 days, Judge Williams sends her on what she
calls an &quot;indefinite sentence,&quot; where she did not specify when Lindsey would
get out.  (30 minutes)

      <description>Stories of people who've grown so accustomed to wartime that the lives they've left behind no longer make sense.

Show host Nancy Updike also hosts a radio movie night. Her pick? The 1946 classic The Best Years of Our Lives , because even though it¹s over 60 years old, it says something about war that's hard to deny, even today.
By Nancy Updike

Ever wondered what you might do with 18 days of rest after serving 15 months in combat? Reporter David Finkel followed one group of soldiers in Iraq for 15 months, and reported all of it in his book The Good Soldiers .

      <description>Stories about the perils of giving and receiving gifts.

Ira Glass hands off the show to guest host Nancy Updike, via a quick cell phone call, as he heads out of town to report a story. Nancy isn't quite sure how how she feels about being given this new role... ambivalence not uncommon for the receivers of gifts. (5 minutes)
By Nancy Updike

Act One
Allison Silverman reports on This Is Your Life , a show from the 1950s where unsuspecting—and often famous—audience members would have their biographies created on the spot for 40 million viewers.

Act One
The formula for Coca-Cola is one of the most jealously guarded trade secrets in the world. So we were surprised to come across a 1979 newspaper article with what looked like the original recipe for Coke. Talking to historian Mark Pendergrast, author of For God, Country and Coca-Cola , we were even more surprised when we found reasons to believe the recipe is real. (25 minutes)

Thanksgiving 2002, the Ohm family's dinner conversation turned to the recent terrorist attacks.

Ira Glass explains that, like the rest of America, we at This American Life are not tired of those stories of women who have no idea they're pregnant and then—poof—one day a baby pops out. Ira and several of our producers speak with Jennifer Lyne, who found out just a few days before giving birth and even appeared on the TV show I Didn't Know I Was Pregnant . Ira also speaks with a psychiatrist named Dr. Nehama Dresner about patients who go a long time in denial about physical conditions. (8 1/2 minutes)

By David Holthouse

Act Two
In Sean Lewis’ family, there is a legendarily romantic love story. It’s famous in his family partly because the story unfolded over decades and across continents, but also because no one can quite believe that out of everyone in their family, the one with the epic, swoon-inducing love story…is Mark. Sean is a performer and playwright now touring with two shows, which you can learn about at his website . (14 minutes)

      <description>Two best friends get tired of yelling at their TVs and decide to form a Tea Party chapter to effect political change.

Republican Bill Jerke, a very conservative former Colorado State Legislator known as a tax &quot;enemy,&quot; has a surprising job this election season.  He's going around to lots of different conservative groups and urging voters NOT to vote for three Colorado ballot initiatives that would cut state taxes so severely, they'd essentially strangle state government from here on out. Jerke says he appreciates the sentiment behind the ballot initiatives but says they simply go too far.  It's a weird election year—it's not just the political parties fighting each other but it's also the parties fighting amongst themselves, trying to figure out what they stand for, what they want for the future and what's the best path to get there. (4 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Rich Carlson and Tom Swenor, two best friends in Michigan, got so fed up with the political process in the country, they decided to form their own Tea Party chapter in Petoskey, Michigan.

In the end, their idealism, their jobs and their friendship have suffered the consequences. This American Life producer Ben Calhoun tells the story. (34 minutes)

In the other camp are the things that live inside of us, the bacterias and viruses, the worms and protozoans, in short, parasites. Scientists estimate that the parasites outnumber us and our free-living allies by 3 to 1. Carl Zimmer talks with Ira about how parasites manage the trick of living inside of us, behind enemy lines, without us finding out. Carl is the author of the book &quot; Parasite Rex .&quot; (10 minutes)
By Ira Glass
Song:“I Live Off You” by X-Ray Spex

Act Three
Another story about parasites. When Jasper Lawrence learned that hookworms might lessen the effects of his allergies, he set out on a unique mission: To travel to West Africa and purposefully become infected with the parasite. What he did next is even more surprising. Patrick Walters reported this story for Radiolab , a production of WNYC and NPR. (14 minutes)

      <description>A car plant in Fremont California that might have saved the U.S. car industry.

Host Ira Glass introduces the story of  the New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., aka NUMMI. In 1984, General Motors and Toyota opened NUMMI as a joint venture. Toyota showed GM the secrets of its production system: How it made cars of much higher quality and much lower cost than GM achieved. But today, GM cars still don't have the quality of Japanese imports, GM is bankrupt and on March 31, NUMMI will
be closed, sending thousands of car workers looking for jobs. In this hour-long story, NPR Automotive Correspondent Frank Langfitt tells the story of NUMMI and why GM—and the rest of the American car business—wasn't able to learn from it more quickly. (4 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
The rise of NUMMI, or how one of the worst auto plants in America started producing some of its best cars, thanks to lessons learned from the Toyota production system. (25 minutes)

Case in point, the 2009 Kentucky Derby, whose winner was the second-biggest long shot in the history of that race. You can watch video of that win here . (8 minutes)

      <description>Tales of estranged sisters, BFFs breaking up, and how reality stars walk the fine line between making friends and getting famous.

Host Ira Glass plays tape of two women who ended up as frenemies.They kept trying to be friends, but couldn't help themselves from fighting. Ira then speaks with psychologist Julianne Holt-Lunstad who has run scientific studies to answer the question: Why don't we simply end these troubling kinds of friendships? Holt-Lunstad's research also shows that these relationships are much more common than you might think. (7 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Family members can easily be frenemies. You're stuck with them. You love them. They sometimes do things that make you feel very strange. Which is how Jeanne Darst felt when her sister married a Muslim man and pulled away from her family. Darst is finishing her first book, Fiction Ruined My Family . (16 minutes)
By Jeanne Darst
Song:“My Sister” by Julianna Hatfield

Act Two
We head to deep inside the natural habitat of frenemies: Reality TV. Rich Juzwiak is a full-time blogger for VH1 and his own pop-culture blog which means he's spent a lot of time watching and dissecting reality TV shows. And last year, he noticed that one sentence seems to repeat an awful lot in the frenemy friendships that happen on reality TV. (5 minutes)
By Rich Juzwiak

Act Three
Ira talks with lexicographer Erin McKean about the origin of the word frenemy. (6 minutes)

Act Four
David Rakoff demonstrates—in rhyme—how to make a wedding toast for people you never wanted to see married in the first place. Rakoff is the author of several books, most recently Half Empty . (15 minutes)

      <description>Nine radio reporters. Two days. One rest stop on the New York State Thruway.


Act One
Host Ira Glass describes scenes from a rest stop on the New York State Thruway, the Plattekill Travel Plaza, and the kind of people you might meet if you ever stayed long enough to talk with them.

      <description>The U.S. government spent two years on a sting operation trapping an Indian man suspected of being an illegal arms dealer.

Host Ira Glass describes a recent terrorism case in Newburgh, N.Y., in which four men were arrested after planting bombs in front of a synagogue and Jewish community center. Ira discusses the case with Aziz Huq, assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School and co-author of Unchecked and Unbalanced: Presidential Power in a Time of Terror . Huq says the Newburgh case isn't what it seems, because without the help of a government informant, the four men probably wouldn't have been able to organize an act of terrorism. The Newburgh case is part of a pattern of sting operations the government has undertaken since September 11th as part of its mandate to catch terrorists before they strike. The first big investigation to test this approach—the case of Hemant Lakhani—is the subject of today's show. (3 minutes).
By Ira Glass

Act One
Hemant Lakhani, an Indian-born British citizen, had been a salesman all his life. Clothing, rice, oil...it didn't matter to him what, as long as he could spin a deal. Then one day, sitting in a hotel room with a gangster he happened to know, the phone rang. It wasa business friend of the gangster's, calling from America. The man on the phone was rich, Lakhani was told. Maybe he would invest in Lakhani's latest venture. So Lakhani started talking to the man over the phone. Pretty soon they set up a meeting at a hotel in New Jersey, to talk business. But when Lakhani got there, the man seemed to be only interested in buying weapons. Illegal weapons, for Somali terrorists. Lakhani, always eager to make a deal, said he can help him out. What he didn't know, is that the supposed rich business man was an FBI informant, and that he had just walked into an elaborate government sting. Petra Bartosiewicz reports. (30 minutes)
By Petra Bartosiewicz

Act Two
Our story about Hemant Lakhani's case continues, through the sting and the trial. (21 minutes.)

Host Ira Glass talks about the infamous line in the band Van Halen's contract insisting that the groups' dressing room include a bowl of M&amp;Ms with all the brown M&amp;Ms removed. Ira used to think this request was just petulant rock-star behavior.

Host Ira Glass talks with Michael Perrino, a law professor at St Johns University School of Law in New York, who wrote a book about Ferdinand Pecora called The Hellhound of Wall Street . Pecora was the lead attorney in the Senate Banking Committee hearings in the 1930s looking into wrongdoing in the banking industry. When he got the job, he turned the hearings from an unimportant and not terrible useful exercise into a real investigation into Wall Street and the causes of the 1929 stock market collapse. It spurred Congress to pass landmark reforms regulating Wall Street. Ira and Perrino talk about whether these kinds of hearings could or should happen today. (9 minutes)

Reluctantly, they listened to Harold, even though his son-in-law's family was making a fortune investing with Madoff. But as history would have it, Harold would come out in the know. (8 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
For NPR's Adam Davidson, dropping out of college is the worst thing any young person can do in this economy. So when Adam's favorite cousin DJ does just that, Adam brings in a professor of economics from Georgetown University to help persuade DJ to get back on the right track. Only after hearing them both out, the professor thinks Adam, not DJ, might be the one on the wrong side of things. (10 minutes)

Song:“Don't Be a Dropout” by James Brown

Act Two
Rany Jazayerli was thrilled when one of his closest friends, Mazen, was hired by the Obama campaign as the liaison to the Muslim community, in the months before the presidential election. It only took 3 weeks for a newspaper to attack his character, and for Mazen to resign from the job of a lifetime. Rany reads about the incident, from a piece he wrote for FiveThirtyEight.com . (7 minutes)
By Rany Jazayerli

Act Three
Sketch comedy troupe Kasper Hauser performs a radio game show, where a race car driver, a guy fluent in middle English, and a teacher take turns cramming all the 21st century wisdom they can into a 30 second phone call to the 14th century. (4 minutes)

      <description>We tackle a very tough subject: Trying to explain exactly what a bank is and does.

Host Ira Glass plays clips from TV in a recent senate hearing and talks about how confusing the current banking crisis is.  But fortunately today, we have the team that brought us our show that explained the mortgage crisis a year ago, back to explain entire the banking system in 40 minutes. (3 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Alex Blumberg and Adam Davidson tackle a very tough subject: Trying to explain exactly what a bank is and does. They talk to a number of experts about what has gone wrong in banking, but not before bringing us all up to speed on some banking basics, like understanding a bank balance sheet, and a bank's assets and liabilities, and the squishy business of what banks say about their balance sheets compared to what they are. Alex and Adam walk us step by step through the complications of the US government buying up bad assets from banks, and explain why, when it comes to footing the bill, the government might just prefer to not be in charge of the very banks it is having taxpayers bailout. From a dollhouse, to a hypothetical bank worth tens of dollars, to the trillions of dollars being spent to keep banks afloat, Alex and Adam talk economy, and where we might be headed. (39 minutes)

      <description>Of the billions of people in the world, what are the odds that any two people are a real match?

NPR reporter David Kestenbaum tells host Ira Glass about the time, when he was doing graduate work in physics, he and his other single friends decided to figure out the mathematical probability that they'd find girlfriends. They wanted to know what the chances were that there was more than one person in the world for them. And This American Life Producer Alex Blumberg and his wife, Nazanin Rafsanjani, reveal the subject of their first fight: They were in love, walking in the park, when Nazanin asked him if it felt like fate—like she was the only one for him. (Yes Alex, there is a wrong answer to that question.) When you're in love, it always feels like it was meant to be, whether or not it really, statistically speaking, is. (9 minutes)
By Alex Blumberg David Kestenbaum

Act One
When Eric Hayot was 23, he went on an exchange program to China one summer. He took an opera class on a lark, and before he knew it, he was on stage, singing the part of a famous judge. Accompanying him, on a traditional two-stringed fiddle, was a 19-year-old musician named Yuanyuan Di. Eric fell for her the moment he saw her, and began spending time with her. But a couple of weeks later he went back to the States, and that was that. They didn't keep in touch—it was too hard to communicate by letter. Then, two years later, Eric went back to China to study, and decided he had to find Yuanyuan again. Only he didn't have her phone number, or address or any other way to contact her. So to track her down, he deployed his secret weapon: The fact that Chinese people love it when westerners sing Chinese songs. This American Life Producer Sarah Koenig reports. (19 minutes)

      <description>Stories about what happens when someone new takes over—someone with a vision of how things ought to be.

Dave Hill tells us about his job at a homeless shelter in New York. He liked the job—even the most menial parts. After about a year, he's asked to;become supervisor, which is exciting for him, because he's never been in charge of anything before. But on his very first shift, something goes terribly wrong, without Dave even knowing about it. (3 minutes)
By Dave Hill

Act One
Dave Hill continues his story. When he talked to a co-worker the morning after his first shift as a night supervisor, he learned that the place isn’t quite what he thought it was. For one thing, most of his colleagues are crack addicts. (7 minutes) Dave is the star of a late-night talk show called the Dave Hill Explosion, which he performs at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York.
By Dave Hill

Act Two
An accountant, Bruce Wisan, is hired by the state of Utah to clean up a very complicated mess in a complicated place: Short Creek, home to hundreds of members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints—or FLDS, which practices polygamy. The community had been run by the notorious Warren Jeffs, now in prison for rape. Jeffs had been in charge of the FLDS church, and also of the giant trust which church members paid into all their lives. But when Jeffs became a fugitive, he began to mismanage the $112 million trust, and so the Utah attorney general stepped in, giving Wisan control. Wisan had plans: He was going to modernize the town utilities, improve the roads, and most important, give people titles to their homes, which under Jeffs were owned and controlled by the church trust. But Wisan quickly ran into an enormous problem: The majority of people in Short Creek would have nothing to do with him or his ideas. Claire Hoffman reports. Claire also wrote about Wisan for Portfolio Magazine in June 2008, in an article called &quot; Satan's Accountant .&quot; (23 minutes)

      <description>On the eve of Obama's inauguration, we sent reporters out to talk to people about how they're feeling.

Back in November, two weeks after he was elected president, Barack Obama delivered a pre-taped speech to an international conference on global warming that was convened in Los Angeles by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. It wasn't Obama's most important speech, but the effect it had on the audience was profound—mostly because they heard it through the haze of the last eight years. Host Ira Glass talks about how so many people right now are having these ding-dong-the-witch-is-dead moments. And how the entire country is poised for change, welcome or not. (7 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
The newspaper Military Times did a survey of 2000 active duty servicemen and women, asking them about the new president. Presented with the statement, &quot;As president, Barack Obama will have my best interests at heart,&quot; 36 percent agreed...43 percent disagreed. Reporter Peter Biello talks to marines from Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, NC, as they were getting their hair trimmed at the Pro-Kutz Barbershop across the street from the base. And This American Life Producer Nancy Updike visits the office of a veterans' organization called the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. (9 minutes)
By Nancy Updike

Act Two
In this act, kids from the after-school literacy program &quot;826&quot; in Brooklyn, Los Angeles, Chicago and Ann Arbor read letters they wrote to Barack Obama. The letters are part of a book the kids published, called Thanks and Have Fun Running the Country . (3 minutes) The book is available now from the McSweeney's website and all proceeds, every penny from the book will go directly to the 826 writing centers across the country.

Song:“Controversy” by Prince

Act Three
When Barack Obama chose Rick Warren of Saddleback Church to give a prayer at his inauguration, gay and lesbian groups cried foul, because of Warren's past remarks about homosexuality and gay marriage. But Rick Warren's constituents—Christian conservatives—also got angry. Ira talks to Dr. Joel Hunter, who's having déjà vu over the whole thing. He's a conservative pastor who Obama chose to give the benediction at the Democratic National Convention. (7 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act Four
Well over two years ago, long before the country chose Barack Obama...a company called Tigereye Design in Greenville, Ohio chose him. The owners liked Obama as a candidate and they approached him and asked if they could make buttons and posters and yard signs for the campaign and its online store. If Barack Obama could do for the economy what he did for Tigereye, we would all be very lucky. This American Life Producer Lisa Pollak dropped by the factory to watch them crank out more merchandise, just a week before Inauguration Day. (5 minutes)
By Lisa Pollak

Act Five
Barack Obama's transition team made it clear this week that the incoming president plans to order the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp on his first full day in office. It's also likely that he'll immediately suspend the military commissions held there—the special courts the military set up in Guantanamo that have been widely criticized as unfair to the detainees. This American Life Producer Sarah Koenig talked to one of the military lawyers currently defending a Guantanamo detainee about all this—what's going on there, and what should happen next. (9 minutes)

      <description>We document life in a mall in Tennessee during the run-up to Christmas.

Most media stories set in shopping malls don't  really tell you much about what it feels like for the people who work in a big retail operation, or for the people who hang out at the mall. Because the mall's more than just sales. Today’s show begins at a table in the food court, near Sbarro’s, in the Cool Springs Galleria, outside Nashville. That’s where Ira Glass found Nick, Cheyenne, Natalie and Chase – teenagers hanging out, killing time before a movie. (5 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
We meet Russell, 19, the best mobile phone salesman in the mall — and possibly anywhere. His talent for sales is matched only by those of his girlfriend, Chandler, 18, a waitress. (6 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act Two
Yes, some stores are going out of business in the Cool Springs Galleria, but it's just two stores. We talk to staff at one store that’s closing down, and at another, in the food court, where business is great. That’s maybe the most surprising thing about how this recession is playing out — that some stores are doing just fine. (10 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act Three
A tale of two Santas. There's Tim Conaghan, a full-time professional Santa with a big belly and a real flowing white beard. And there's Santa Nick—he too has a belly and real white beard. But the story of Santa Tim and Santa Nick is not like most uplifting Christmas parables. Instead, it's about two men, very much alike, who came to lead rival factions in a bitter Santa civil war, and came themselves to be arch enemies. Josh Bearman reports on the political schism that's overtaken the Amalgamated Order of Real Bearded Santas. (27 minutes)

      <description>Stories of people who ruin things for everyone else, or who are accused of that.

A bad apple, at least at work, can spoil the whole barrel. And there's research to prove it. Host Ira Glass talks to Will Felps , a professor at Rotterdam School of Management in the Netherlands, who designed an experiment to see what happens when a bad worker joins a team. Felps divided people into small groups and gave them a task. One member of the group would be an actor, acting either like a jerk, a slacker or a depressive. And within 45 minutes, the rest of the group started behaving like the bad apple. (12 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Measles cases are higher in the U.S. than they've been in a decade, mostly because more and more nervous parents are refusing to vaccinate their kids. Contributing Editor Susan Burton tells the story of what happened recently in San Diego, when an unvaccinated 7-year-old boy returned home from a trip to Switzerland, bringing with him the measles. By the end of the ordeal, 11 other children caught the disease, and more than 60 kids had to be quarantined. (22 minutes)

      <description>A man in Pakistan buys an amulet with the power to protect anyone from harm. He tests it out on a chicken.

Host Ira Glass point out that it's not enough this time of year that we eat millions of turkeys. Someone also went to the trouble to make up a song about turkeys getting the supernatural power to play baseball. And of course, we play you this song. (2 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Greg Warner was living in Pakistan, on the border of Afghanistan, when he met a man—a tough guy, former smuggler—who wanted to break his friend out of prison. He'd bought an expensive amulet, to keep his friend safe during the breakout. But he wanted to test out the amulet first. On a chicken. So Greg and the man and Greg's translator go up into the hills, put the amulet on the chicken, and start shooting. Greg is a reporter based in Afghanistan. (13 minutes)
By Greg Warner

Act Two
Kathie Russo's husband was Spalding Gray , who was best known for delivering monologues onstage—like &quot;Monster in a Box,&quot; and &quot;Swimming to Cambodia.&quot; On January 10, 2004, he went missing. Witnesses said they saw him on the Staten Island Ferry that night. Two months later, his body was pulled out of the East River. Kathie tells the story of the night he disappeared, and about how, in the weeks following, she and each of their three children were visited by a bird, who seemed to be delivering a message to them. (10 minutes)
By Spalding Gray Kathie Russo

Act Three
Working in a poultry processing plant is one of the most unpleasant jobs you can get in this country. It's low-paid, dangerous and difficult. Barely any poultry plants are represented by a union, especially in the South, where most of the plants are located. So worker rights advocates rely in large part on the church to help them organize workers. And in the past few years, they've been trying something new: They've been using the church to intervene with company management in a very, very personal way. This American Life producer Sarah Koenig tells the story of how one organizer tried this method with a manager at a company called Case Farms, and a plant they have in Morganton, North Carolina. You can learn more in the film Mississippi Chicken , a documentary about poultry factory workers in Canton, Mississippi. (15 minutes)
By Sarah Koenig

Act Four
Wayne Curtis has been puzzling over an unexplained meteorological phenomenon involving chickens...a riddle that's nearly two centuries old. Wayne is the author, most recently, of And A Bottle of Rum: A History of the New World in Ten Cocktails . (6 minutes)

Host Ira Glass talks to Kathy from Hoboken, NJ, who has become obsessed with people who get away with parking violations in her town—where parking is scarce and parking laws are enforced vigilantly. Except when they aren't. (5 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Studs Terkel , the Chicago reporter who recorded oral histories of ordinary Americans, died last week. We assembled a collection of his work from his Hard Times radio series, in which people talk about their experiences during the Depression—how everyone simultaneously became poor, regardless of their class. (32 minutes) You can listen to more of Studs Terkel's work here .

Act Two
Ira talks to Rev. Donald Sharp, of Faith Tabernacle Church in Chicago. Reverend Sharp, who is black, served in the segregated armed forces during World War II. Now, he sees Obama’s election very differently than his children and grandchildren do. They're ecstatic, while he can't shake his suspicion that racism will persist in this country. (6 minutes)

      <description>We go to Pennsylvania to figure out why both McCain and Obama think they can win there.

Host Ira Glass goes to a McCain rally in Lehigh, PA, outside of Allentown. Obama has double-digit leads over McCain in almost every poll. So why does McCain still think he has a shot? (5 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
In Scranton, there's a &quot;Citizens for McCain&quot; office. But really, it's a &quot;Democrats for McCain&quot; office; flipping Democrats is vital if McCain is going to win. Producer Nancy Updike spent some time with these anti-Obama Democrats, who apparently have a message that's pitch perfect for their fellow disgruntled party members. (9 minutes)
By Nancy Updike

Act Two
While McCain gathers stray Democrats, Obama is trying to find new ones—in the reddest part of the state. To do that, his campaign has launched enormous registration drives, especially among college students. Producer Sarah Koenig followed registration workers around State College, home to Penn State University, to see how they were doing. (13 minutes)
By Sarah Koenig

Act Three
No one much likes to talk about it out loud, but everyone knows it's true: There are a lot of people out there who say they won't vote for Obama because he's black. To fight this problem, Richard Trumka, secretary treasurer of the AFL-CIO, has been traveling around the country giving a speech to fellow union members. It ends with a plea: You must stand up, and deal with race directly. Talk about it. Producer Lisa Pollak spent a month hanging out with union members, eavesdropping on their conversations, to see if Trumka's directive was working. (17 minutes)
By Lisa Pollak

Act Four
We continue our story about voter registration in State College, where there are only a few days left until the registration deadline. (7 minutes)

Host Ira Glass talks with Andy Woolworth, an executive vice president in charge of new product development at the world's largest manufacturer of mousetraps, Woodstream Corporation, in Lititz, Pennsylvania. About once a month, Andy is contacted by someone who thinks he's invented a better mousetrap. He and Ira review some of the ideas that seemed particularly bad. (7 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Karen Sosnoski's one-year-old son, Anton, was born with what's known as Mosaic Down Syndrome , a rare condition where some of his cells have the extra chromosome that causes Down syndrome and other cells don't. So as he grows, he could end up having all the health risks and challenges of Down syndrome...or just a few of them. Through a website, Karen found a kid with the same diagnosis, named Tim Colvin, who was doing really well...perhaps because his mother, Kristy, invented a surprising and unusual way to raise her son. When some people hear about what Kristy did, they're shocked. Karen went to talk to Kristy and Tim about how Tim was raised. (14 minutes)

Song:“I Know Who I Am” by Bunny Rugs

Act Two
Looked at one way, the current flailing economy is a victim of invention—Wall Street invention. Investors and banks and brokers created all sorts of stuff the world would've been better off without. In the aftermath, Democrats have blamed Republicans for the mess, and, naturally, Republicans have blamed Democrats. Ira talks to Charles Duhigg , whose been covering the subprime mortgage crisis for The New York Times , to find out who we should really be mad at. (10 minutes)

Song:“Regulators” by Warren G

Act Three
Nellie Thomas sold ammunition illegally on the South side of Chicago. He made a good living—in cash. And that was his problem. The money was driving him crazy. He was ashamed to tell his family how he earned it, he was afraid he'd be robbed, and he didn't know how to get rid of it. So he kept it in big black garbage bags which he hid around his house and yard. Then one day, he came up with the perfect way to get rid of the money. Sudhir Alladi Venkatesh tells Nellie's story. Sudhir is a sociology professor at Columbia University and author of Off the Books: The Underground Economy of the Urban Poor . (15 minutes)

      <description>A look at what regulators could've done to prevent the financial crisis from happening in the first place.

Host Ira Glass goes to Union Square, a 15-minute subway ride from Wall Street, where it doesn't look like we're on the edge of an economic abyss. (2 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Alex Blumberg and Adam Davidson recount the 36-hour period, two weeks ago, when the credit markets froze. Plus, what it's like now for businesses to get short-term loans, and how the hardship is spreading to every sector of the economy. (16 minutes)
By Alex Blumberg Adam Davidson Planet Money

Act Two
One more confusing financial product that's bringing down the global economy. And one of way to think about this product is this: If bad mortgages got the financial system sick, this next thing you're about to hear about, helped spread the sickness into an epidemic. These are &quot;credit default swaps.&quot; Alex explains. (19 minutes)
By Alex Blumberg Planet Money

Act Three
Ira talks with Michael Greenberger, a former commodities regulator, who tells the story of when it was decided not to regulate credit default swaps. And how that decision was emblematic of the way we didn't regulate a lot of the toxic financial products we're hearing about now. (7 minutes)

Amy Roberts thought it was obvious that she was an adult, not a kid, and she assumed the friendly man working at the children's museum knew it too. Unfortunately, the man had Amy pegged all wrong.

Host Ira Glass talks with an NPR business and economics correspondent about two gatherings he attended—one at the Ritz Carlton and one at a community college in Brooklyn. The first was an awards dinner for finance professionals who created the mortgage-based financial instruments that nearly brought down the global economic system.

Ira explains that today's show lays out how the finance guys and the people facing foreclosure are connected by a chain of middlemen, and that together, they all brought about the current housing and credit crisis.

(5 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Ira Glass tells the story of a little-known treaty dispute with far-reaching ramifications for our understanding of executive power. The dispute is between the President and one of his appointees...to the International Boundary Commission with Canada.

Act Two
This American Life contributor Jack Hitt uncovers a strange practice within the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service. If a foreign national marries a U.S. citizen and schedules an interview for a green card, but the U.S. citizen dies before the interview takes place, the foreign national is scheduled for deportation with no appeal—even if the couple has children who are U.S. citizens. Jack talks with Brent Renison , a lawyer who's representing over 130 people in this situation, mostly widows, who are seeking to overturn the Immigration Service's rule. (20 minutes)

      <description>In 1912, a four-year-old boy went missing in Louisiana. Eight months later, he was found. But two grief-stricken mothers both claimed the same boy as their own.

Ira Glass plays the song &quot;Mystery of the Dunbar's Child&quot; by Richard &quot;Rabbit&quot; Brown. It describes Bobby Dunbar's disappearance and recovery and the trial of his kidnapper, all of which was front page news from 1912 to 1914. Almost a century after it happened, Bobby Dunbar's granddaughter, Margaret Dunbar Cutright, was looking into her grandfather's disappearance and found that the truth was actually more interesting than the legend. And a lot more troubling. (1 minute)

      <description>Teachers tell us about a secret room in the New York City Board of Education building called &quot;the rubber room.&quot;

Host Ira Glass talks with a veteran Human Resources administrator about what it's like to fire people, and why it helps if you don't actually use the word &quot;fire.&quot; (7 minutes)

Act One
We hear from New York City school teachers about a secret room in the New York City Board of Education building. Teachers are told to report there, and when they arrive, they find out they're under investigation for something. They have to wait in this room all day, every day, until the matter is cleared up. They call this bureaucratic purgatory &quot;the rubber room.&quot; Some teachers have been stuck in it for years. (23 minutes) This story was produced by Joe Richman, Samara Freemark, and Anayansi Diaz Cortes of Radio Diaries . We first heard about the rubber room from a documentary by Jeremy Garrett. There's a trailer at rubberroommovie.com . Update: in 2010 the City and the teacher's union came to an agreement that will close the Rubber Room.

Song:“Waiting Room” by Fugazi

Act Two
American cities have gone through a massive wave of gentrification in the last few decades. To some people, it's not a natural ebb and flow of the real estate market, but a plot, by rich, mainly white people, to take over the neighborhoods of poor, mainly black people. This American Life producer Jon Jeter reports on how, in neighborhoods all over the country, the plot has a name, &quot;The Plan,&quot; and most people you talk to know about it. (11 minutes)

      <description>Making a lasting love match isn't as simple as writing a check.

Ira Glass talks to This American Life Producer Jane Feltes about
a recent date she was set up on by a friend. The date was awful—the guy
seemed stoned the whole time. But worse than a wasted evening was the
thought: what must her friend think of her if he's setting her up with
this guy? (5 minutes)
By Jane Feltes

Act One
Miriam and her husband were development workers in Afghanistan. They'd had a whirlwind romance themselves, so when they heard that their driver was in love, but didn't have enough money to propose to the girl, they made a grand romantic gesture: They gave him $10,000 to pay for the dowry and the wedding. It was a move they probably should have known wouldn't work out so well. Gregory Warner reports. (16 minutes)

There was a body to be buried, a house full of stuff to get rid of—but no family or friends to deal with it all. Luckily, there was Emily, an investigator for the Los Angeles Public Administrator's Office. It's her job to take care of the remains of lives like Mary Ann's. Eric Klinenberg reports the story.

According to 52 Indian men whom Pickle hired and brought to America, Pickle was trying to compete with foreign companies, doing something most companies never try.

Act Two
Anthony Pico was a foster kid for most of his life. His mother was a crack addict who abandoned him, and he bounced around from house to house, relative to relative. But unlike a lot of foster kids, he had an amazing ability to talk about his life eloquently. He started getting invited to child welfare conferences, presenting to social workers and politicians and bureaucrats about problems with the foster care system. He got so good at it that he turned into a professional foster kid. Reporter Doug McGray tells Anthony's story. (20 minutes) Doug McGray is a fellow at the New America Foundation .

      <description>Stories about people taking history into their own hands.

Dal LaMagna, millionaire and creator of the Tweezerman tweezer, prepares to go to Iraq on a diplomatic mission he invented for himself—despite concern (and mocking) from his own sister. (2 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Dal LaMagna made a fortune selling high-quality grooming products. And after retiring, he wanted to do some good in the world. His plan: Curb the violence in Iraq. He thought he could get the Sunni resistance to sit down with Coalition forces to negotiate a cease-fire. So he hooked up with a member of the Iraqi parliament named Mohammed Al-Dynee and headed to Baghdad and Amman, where, remarkably, doors opened to him. This American Life gave Dal an audio recorder to carry into his meetings, and he recorded 25 hours of his remarkable journey through the Middle East as a would-be citizen-diplomat. Producer Sarah Koenig sifted through the 25 hours, talked to Dal about what happened, and put together this story. (22 minutes) Dal also ran for President .

      <description>Stories about the pitfalls of trying to do the right thing.

Host Ira Glass talks to Tim Jaccard, who used to be a police medic. The calls he hated most were all the same: &quot;Baby not breathing.&quot; So in 1998, he helped write the first &quot;safe haven&quot; law, which allows mothers to safely abandon their babies without getting into trouble. Jaccard started the AMT Children of Hope Foundation , and he runs its safe haven program. But even now, there are some babies he just can't save. (4 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Say there's a group of five people standing on a train track, and you're on a train coming toward them. You can save the whole group by pulling a lever and switching to another track, but the catch is that you'll kill another person who's standing on that other track. Do you pull the lever? According to Harvard scientist Mark Hauser , who posed this question to hundreds of thousands of people on the Internet, nine out of 10 people say yes, they would pull the lever. But then, the questions get harder—and the answers much more confusing. It turns out that different parts of our brains make different moral decisions. (11 minutes) This story originally aired on the public radio program Radiolab .
By Radiolab

Act Two
When the U.S. government sent out a call for volunteers—regular, non-military people—to go to Iraq and help rebuild the country, Randy Frescoln signed up. He believed in the cause of the war and in the promise of its mission. He had experience setting up agriculture projects overseas, so was sent to the Sunni Triangle to try to reconstruct the broken economy there. But three months into his yearlong assignment, he comes to a horrible realization: The people he's trying to help hate him. Plus, stories of other people who went to Iraq as &quot;provincial reconstruction team&quot; volunteers. Kiki Munshi, a retired Foreign Service Officer who headed a PRT in the Diyala province speaks to the difficulties she faced as well. Ira interviews her about testimony she gave to Congress about PRTs in Iraq and her personal experience there. Finally, there's Stephanie Miley, an FSO who headed Randy's PRT. She remembers him and understood when he decided to leave, but Stephanie feels that the efforts to improve the state of Iraq are worth it, despite the risk of death. (16 minutes)

      <description>When he was a teenager, Haider worked in the Iraqi Ministry of Information. He was treated like a celebrity.

Host Ira Glass tells a story about how, when he was in seventh grade, he was over at his best friend's house and saw beer in the fridge. He'd only ever seen beer in fridges on TV; he didn't think it existed in real life. It was a little disturbing. And suddenly, he had to reevaluate what he thought of his friend's family. Valentina Filimonova had a similar experience when, two weeks after she arrived in New York from Ukraine, she went to the drugstore to buy tampons. And Starlee Kine describes how her father learned that there was a whole other way to live his life—after staring at a fish tank. (6 minutes)
By Valentina Filimonova Ira Glass Starlee Kine

Act One
When he was a teenager, Haider Hamza worked in the Iraqi Ministry of Information. He was specially trained to talk to visiting dignitaries and foreign reporters, and he loved his job. It was exciting, and he was treated like a celebrity. Then the war broke out, his family fled, his job disappeared, and Haider suddenly had to figure out what to do next: Hide, like his father wanted, or jump into the fray—in one of the most dangerous ways possible. Gideon Yago tells the story. (28 minutes)

By Ira Glass

Josh Bearman grew up in California with his dad, stepmom, and brother. But they're not his whole family. His mom and half-brother David live in Florida.

      <description>Four years into the Iraq War, what have we learned?

There's a 200-person operation based out of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas called the Center for Army Lessons Learned .

By Ira Glass

Act One
This American Life producer Nancy Updike tells the story of Conrad Crane, the head of the U.S. Army Military History Institute . Along with Andrew Terrill, he was commissioned by the Army to look at previous post-war occupations and give advice about how to stabilize and reconstruct post-war Iraq. The booklet they produced , which includes nine pages of detailed instructions on how to occupy Iraq, predicted many of the problems that eventually came to haunt the occupation. Although it was admired by successful commanders in Iraq, including H.R. McMaster, Updike explains why it was ignored by Pentagon officials. (22 minutes)
By Nancy Updike
Song:“Instrumental” by Arthur Russell
Ira speaks with Milt Hileman of the Center for Army Lessons Learned about the single most-requested publication they put out, Soldiers' Handbook: The First 100 Days: Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures .

(5 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act Two
What lessons are civilians taking from the War? One journalist has said that Americans seem condemned &quot;to relive the prewar debates over and over because they were never thrashed out in the sunlight.&quot; In Salt Lake City on May 4, the prewar arguments—and some other arguments as well—were re-argued, on stage, by Salt Lake's liberal mayor Rocky Anderson and conservative radio and TV host Sean Hannity. Scott Carrier attended the event. (13 minutes)

Joseph Margulies, a lawyer for one of the detainees at Guantanamo, explains how the detention facility there was created to be an ideal interrogation facility. Any possible comfort, such as water or natural light, is controlled entirely by the interrogators. (3 minutes)
By Joseph Margulies

Act One
Jack Hitt explains how President Bush's War on Terror changed the rules for prisoners of war and how it is that under those rules, it'd be possible that someone whose classified file declares that they pose no threat to the United States could still be locked up indefinitely—potentially forever!—at Guantanamo.

By Jack Hitt

Act Two
Habeas corpus began in England. And recently, 175 members of the British parliament filed a &quot;friend of the court&quot; brief in one of the U.S. Supreme Court cases on habeas and Guantanamo—apparently, the first time in Supreme Court history that's happened. In their brief, the members of Parliament warn about the danger of suspending habeas: &quot;During the British Civil War, the British created their own version of Guantanamo Bay and dispatched undesirable prisoners to garrisons off the mainland, beyond the reach of habeas corpus relief.&quot; In London, reporter Jon Ronson, author of Them: Adventures with Extremists , goes in search of what happened.

Host Ira Glass talks with some real-live NASA astronauts: Cady Coleman , Chris Cassidy , and Marsha Ivins . On average, NASA schedules just a couple of space missions a year. But it employs 95 astronauts. This means that only a tiny percentage of an astronaut's career is actually spent in space, and some never get there. Ira talks with these three astronauts about how they spend the vast majority of their time: on the ground, in an office, doing paperwork. (8 minutes)

Midway through, they both stopped to think: Why were they getting so upset over an issue they didn't really care about that much? And then they realized: Eric's ex-girlfriend was a political activist, and Eric's friend's ex-boyfriend was a hedge fund manager. Eric and his friend had had a 20-minute proxy argument on behalf of their exes.

Check out the puzzles from that year's hunt . (13 minutes)

      <description>An old man in Brooklyn invites some homeless prostitutes into his house on a cold winter night. They never leave.

Host Ira Glass talks to Randall Bell, who specializes in assessing how tragedy affects real estate. He's found that the market is much quicker to forgive and forget a scandal than the neighbors are. (4 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Joe had lived alone in his big house in Brooklyn for decades. Then one night he saw a few people—prostitutes, actually—shivering outside in the cold, and he opened up his home to them. Pretty soon his upper floors were completely trashed. His house became overrun by the neighborhood's roughest characters, and somehow he couldn't do anything about it. Maherin Gangat reports the story. (23 minutes)
By Maherin Gangat

Act Two
When David Wilcox was eighteen, he set about looking for an apartment in Houston. He had no credit and very little money, but he was determined to move away from home. He finally found a place in the only apartment complex he could afford. After a few disturbing encounters with neighbors—plus a tornado—he realized maybe he needed to think again. (14 minutes)

      <description>An American reporter in Iraq decides to rent a house in a residential Baghdad neighborhood. Plus other big ideas gone amok.

Host Ira Glass talks to an expert stone cutter who makes headstones. One day he got a call from a guy who wanted him to make his headstone in advance, which is not all that uncommon. But on the stone, the man wanted to put pictures of his sons, along with the exact dates of their deaths. The strange thing was, they weren't dead yet. (6 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Radio reporter Adam Davidson went to Iraq to report on the war. He decided that rather than living in some journalist compound in the Green Zone or in a big hotel—places insurgents were more likely to attack—he'd fly under the radar, and keep safe...by renting a house in a residential Baghdad neighborhood. This plan turned out to have some serious flaws—flaws the American military forces were probably all too familiar with. This American Life producer Nancy Updike talked to Adam about his occupation strategy. (27 minutes)

      <description>The mysterious hold supers have on their buildings, or that their buildings have on them.

Host Ira Glass visits the Upper East Side building in Manhattan where Peter Roach has been the super for about ten years. Peter has a lot of keys. He doesn't know what most of them unlock. (4 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Reporter Jack Hitt tells the story of how he helped organize tenants and threaten a rent strike in a New York City building back in the 1980s. Before long, Bob, the building super became his enemy. The situation got pretty ugly. Mobster ugly. Bob began to brag about how important he was in his native Brazil, how he could kill a person and be immune from prosecution. Only many years later did Jack find out how dangerous Bob really was. (23 minutes)
By Jack Hitt
Song:“Superman Theme” by John Williams

Act Two
The super in Josh Bearman's Los Angeles building was kind of a needy character. He would sometimes ask Josh to come into his apartment and help him out -- check whether his garbage was being moved by a ghost, for example. Then one day he told Josh a story that involved these elements: a gas station, a beautiful woman, an orchid, a snowman, Indonesia, and a check he'd written for $30,000. It was so crazy, that naturally, Josh believed it. (12 minutes)

      <description>Stories of Muslims and non-Muslims trying to communicate with each other and not always getting their point across.

In the 1930s, the designer of the U.S. Supreme Court made a frieze to adorn the courtroom walls. It depicted eighteen great lawgivers through ages, including Moses, Solon, Confucius...and Muhammad. The only problem is that Islam forbids such portrayals of the prophet. Host Ira Glass talks to Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations , about why the frieze is offensive to Muslims, and what they tried to do about it. (7 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Serry and her husband's love story began in a place not usually associated with romance: The West Bank. That was where the couple met, fell in love and decided to get married. Then Serry, who was American, convinced her Palestinian husband to move to America. She promised him that in America their children would never encounter prejudice or strife of any kind. But things didn't quite work out that way. This American Life contributor Alix Spiegel tells the story. (33 minutes)

      <description>The remarkable story of what it took to determine the number of Iraqis who've died since the U.S. invasion.

Host Ira Glass talks to ordinary Iraqis about life in their country since the U.S. invasion. Every one of them has friends and relatives—civilians—who've been killed in the violence there. (4 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Two years ago, a Johns Hopkins University study published in The Lancet estimated the number of civilian casualties in Iraq. It came up with a number—100,000 dead—that was higher than any other estimate at the time and was mostly ignored. Producer Alex Blumberg tells the remarkable story of what it took to find that number, why we should find it credible and why almost no one believed it. (37 minutes).
By Alex Blumberg

Act Two
Captain Ryan Gist was given a particularly tough assignment in Iraq: To build relationships with a town where U.S. bombs had killed twelve innocent people. But first he has to apologize to the families of those who were killed. We hear the apology, captured on tape by a journalist in Iraq, and talk to Captain Gist about his work there after this incident. (8 minutes)

      <description>A family uses a controversial therapy to train their son to love them, and other stories about the hard work of loving other people.

Hard as it is to believe, during the early twentieth century, a whole school of mental health professionals decided that unconditional love was a terrible thing to give a child. The government printed pamphlets warning mothers against the dangers of holding their kids. The head of the American Psychological Association and even a mothers' organization endorsed the position that mothers were dangerous - until psychologist Harry Harlow set out to prove them wrong, with a series of experiments with monkeys. Ira talks with Deborah Blum, author of &quot; Love at Goon Park ,&quot; a biography of Harlow. (10 minutes)

By Ira Glass Rosie Schaap

Act One
This parrot story began as a journalism school assignment. Then, for reporters Alex Lane and Eric Holm, it became something much bigger. They tell Ira the epic tale of a rare parrot stolen by &quot;Johnny,&quot; or John Bryant Davila as he likes to be called now, from the Central Park Zoo in 1999. They say it's the best story they've ever worked on, but after years of telling it to friends and strangers, Alex and Eric aren't always sure of where the facts stop and the embellishment begins. So they decide to go back to the main characters and find out. (22 minutes).

Act One
When Gene Cheek was ten years old, his mother began dating a black man. It was 1961, in North Carolina. Segregation was in full effect. They all knew it was going to be problematic, even dangerous. But it wasn't until they landed in court that they realized just how unpopular they had become, or how dire the consequences of his mother's love would be. Gene Cheek has written a book about his family called The Color of Love: A Mother's Choice in the Jim Crow South . (29 minutes)

Act Two
Will Seymour reads letters he and his grandmother exchanged when he was in high school. He was miserable at the time—his parents had just gotten divorced and he had no friends—and so was his grandma.

Ira talks about two live shows that This American Life put on in the early days, both co-hosted by David Hauptschein. One was about letters, and the other was about this then-new phenomenon called the internet.

Act One
Ira and playwright David Hauptschein took out advertisements in Chicago inviting people to come to a small theater with letters they've received, sent or found. People came for two nights, and read their letters onstage. They were old letters. Embarrassing letters. Some were funny. Some were poignant. They told a wide range of stories: A heartfelt letter from prison, a hilariously pretentious job letter sent to the New Yorker magazine, a wringingly sincere teenage &quot;should we be more than friends&quot; letter.

      <description>Stories about people trying to find new solutions to age-old problems.

Host Ira Glass talks with Andy Woolworth, an executive vice president in charge of new product development at the world's largest manufacturer of mousetraps, Woodstrean Corporation, in Lititz, Pennsylvania. About once a month, Andy is contacted by someone who thinks he's invented a better mousetrap. Ira and he review some of the ideas that seemed particularly bad. (6 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Karen Sosnoski's one-year-old son, Anton, was born with what's known as Mosaic Down Syndrome, a rare condition where some of his cells have the extra chromosome that causes Down syndrome and other cells don't. So as he grows, he could end up having all the health risks and challenges of Downs syndrome...or just a few of them. Through a website , Karen found a kid with the same diagnosis, named Tim Colvin, who was doing really well...perhaps because his mother, Kristy, invented a surprising and unusual way to raise her son. When some people hear about what Kristy did, they're shocked. Karen went to talk to Kristy and Tim about how Tim was raised. (13 minutes)

Song:“I Know Who I Am” by Bunny Rugs

Act Two
Nellie Thomas sold ammunition illegally on the South side of Chicago. He made a good living—in cash. And that was his problem. The money was driving him crazy. He was ashamed to tell his family how he earned it, he was afraid he'd be robbed, and he didn't know how to get rid of it. So he kept it in big black garbage bags which he hid around his house and yard. Then one day, he came up with the perfect way to get rid of the money. Sudhir Alladi Venkatesh tells Nellie's story. Sudhir is a sociology professor at Columbia University and recent author of Off the Books: The Underground Economy of the Urban Poor . (15 minutes)

Song:“My Immortal” by Evanescence

Act Three
Reporter Brett Martin tries to use the tools of modern marketing to invent a new religion...one that would serve all the Americans who don't associate with any particular organized religion. It's a lot of people: Forty-three percent of the country says they don't consider themselves religious (according to a 2002 USA Today/Gallup poll). (11 minutes)

      <description>Is Guantanamo Bay a camp full of terrorists, or a camp full of our mistakes?

Joseph Margulies, a lawyer for one of the detainees at Guantanamo, explains how the detention facility there was created to be an ideal interrogation facility. Any possible comfort, such as water or natural light, is controlled entirely by the interrogators. (3 minutes)
By Joseph Margulies

Act One
Jack Hitt explains how President Bush's War on Terror changed the rules for prisoners of war and how it is that under those rules, it'd be possible that someone whose classified file declares that they pose no threat to the United States could still be locked up indefinitely—potentially forever!—at Guantanamo. (26 minutes). Clarification : When Seton Hall professor Baher Azmy discusses the classified file of his client, Murat Kurnaz, he is referring to information that had previously been made public and published in the Washington Post . That material has subsequently been reclassified.
By Jack Hitt

Act Two
Habeas corpus began in England. And recently, 175 members of the British parliament filed a &quot;friend of the court&quot; brief in one of the U.S. Supreme Court cases on habeas and Guantanamo—apparently, the first time in Supreme Court history that's happened. In their brief, the members of Parliament warn about the danger of suspending habeas: &quot;During the British Civil War, the British created their own version of Guantanamo Bay and dispatched undesirable prisoners to garrisons off the mainland, beyond the reach of habeas corpus relief.&quot; In London, reporter Jon Ronson, author of Them: Adventures with Extremists , goes in search of what happened.

      <description>Lotto fever grips the cast of Riverdance.

Prologue
Paul was a cop. One night he was pulling second shift when he had a perfectly good idea: He'd stretch out in the back seat and take a little nap during his break. He fell right asleep, and slept well until he woke up and realized the funny thing about the back seats of cop cars: The doors don't open from the inside. Paul is author of the book Bad Cop: New York's Least Likely Police Officer Tells All . (8 minutes)
By Paul Bacon Ira Glass

Act One
It was two months into the tour. Katie Else and the rest of the Riverdance cast had been performing eight shows a week. They decided to pool their money for the Mega-Millions lottery. Lotto fever gripped the cast. They started to genuinely believe they would take home about $2 million each, and quit Riverdance the next day. They took the stage the night of the drawing and pulled off their best performance ever, &quot;For the Lotto!,&quot; trying to direct their energy towards the win. An hour later, at the hotel bar, the numbers came in. (17 minutes)
By Katie Else Ira Glass
Song:“Lottery” by Marky Ramone &amp; The Intruders

Act Two
After years of neglecting their personal finances, Joel and his wife finally decide to sort things out. They hire a tax accountant named Len, whose casual manner is a real comfort, at first. But then, &quot;casual&quot; turns into &quot;drunk&quot; and then it's clear that he's just plain delinquent. Joel tries to take his business elsewhere, but Len refuses to let go of their file. He begs for a second chance, which it seems, came too late. Joel Lovell is executive editor at Pineapple Street Media . (8 minutes)
By Joel Lovell

      <description>A rising star in the evangelical movement casts aside the idea of hell.

Carlton Pearson's church, Higher Dimensions, was once one of the biggest in the city, drawing crowds of 5,000 people every Sunday. But several years ago, scandal engulfed the reverend. He didn't have an affair. He didn't embezzle lots of money. His sin was something that to a lot of people is far worse: He stopped believing in hell. (2 minutes)
By Russell Cobb

Act One
Reporter Russell Cobb takes us through the remarkable and meteoric rise of Carlton Pearson from a young man to a Pentecostal Bishop: From the moment he first cast the devil out of his 17-year-old girlfriend, to the days when he had a close, personal relationship with Oral Roberts and had appearances on TV and at the White House. Just as Reverend Pearson's career peaked, with more than 5,000 members of his congregation coming every week, he started to think about hell, wondering if a loving God would really condemn most of the human race to burn and writhe in the fire of hell for eternity.

      <description>Variations on an old tale, with very modern consequences.

Lisa LaBorde has two daughters, and having grown up an only child, she can't understand why they fight all the time. Her idea of sisterhood is more like a scene from The Sound of Music. Wanting to create that kind of bond for her girls, Lisa decides to enlist the aid of science to see if she can turn these enemies into friends—in just one month. (4 minutes)
By Lisa LaBorde

Act One
Continuing from our prologue, host Ira Glass checks in with Lisa and her older daughter, Kennedy, to see how the experiment went. After a month, they've charted surprising results, learned that the girls aren't the only ones in the house who need to change, and found out just how much money it takes to get a twelve-year-old to play with a five-year-old. (14 minutes)

Song:“It's a Shame” by Monie Love

Act Two
Rachel Louise Snyder reports on the struggle to save the Cambodian economy. Right now, Cambodia is competing with other nations for the business of big clothing companies all over the world—buyers like the Gap, Nike, Adidas. But they've vowed to follow fair labor practices, which, while eliminating sweatshops for workers, also makes their costs higher. Other countries end up with the contracts—and the profits. So an official Cambodian committee sets out on a mission to convince the U.S. Congress to give them a special trade agreement, before time runs out. With additional reporting by TAL producer Lisa Pollak. (30 minutes)

      <description>Three people tell their stories from Iraq about the fighting, the locals, and why you subscribe to Details magazine.

It took almost a month for Eli Ramirez to make it to this country. A native of Guatemala, he was smuggled through Mexico in the transport tank of a fuel truck, he was stranded in the desert, and forced to drink his own urine to survive. But just 24 hours after he made it to Chicago, he found himself at Charlie Trotters—one of the most exclusive, expensive, and fanciest restaurants in the country—a place unlike anything he'd ever seen before (4 minutes). If you'd like to read more about Eli, his story is featured in the new book An Immigrant Class: Oral Histories from Chicago's Newest Immigrants , by Jeff Libman.
By Eli Ramirez

Act One
Chris Tenove had this idea he thought could really make a difference for people in the developing world. The thought was to bring well-meaning tourists where their money would do the most good, spend some time with the locals, and then leave behind a little money to help out. To see if his idea has any merit, Chris decided to try it out...by himself. In Sierra Leone. (19 minutes)

      <description>Stories about the lengths we go to make things right, and about what money can and cannot fix.

Erin Einhorn grew up begging her mother to tell her all about the remarkable story of how she survived World War Two, thanks to a Polish woman named Honorata Skowronski, who risked her life. But her mother didn't like to talk about it. And somehow, her family didn't consider Honorata a hero. So Erin went to Poland, hoping to find the Skowronski family and reintroduce them to her mom, and figure out what happened.  Erin elaborates on this story in her book, The Pages In Between . (5 minutes)
By Erin EInhorn

Act One
Erin Einhorn's story continues. She tells what happens once she arrives in Poland. Things start well, with the kind of sweet, tearful reunion she hoped for. That is, until the family starts explaining that they need Erin's help to keep a 60-year-old promise that her grandfather made. Erin immediately agreed, but now after years of effort, thousands of dollars, and a trail of letters which uncovered a whole new side to the story, Erin is asking: How far do you go to repay this kind of debt?

      <description>A study estimated the number of Iraqi casualties since the war began at 100,000. Most of the deaths were caused by coalition forces.

We're a nation at war, but it hardly feels like it. That contrast is especially jarring for people like Hannah Allam, who just returned home to Oklahoma after two years in Baghdad running the Knight-Ridder Newspapers bureau there. Host Ira Glass talks with Hannah and Army Captain Chuck Ziegenfuss about what it feels like to come home from a war that nobody's paying much attention to. (5 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
About a year ago, a John Hopkins University study in the British medical journal The Lancet estimated the number of civilian casualties in Iraq. It came up with a number—100,000 dead—that was higher than any other estimate, and was mostly ignored. This week, Producer Alex Blumberg tells the remarkable story of what it took to find that number, why we should find it credible and why almost no one believed it. (The original Lancet study is online; free registration is required). (38 minutes)
By Alex Blumberg

Act Two
Captain Ryan Gist was given a particularly tough assignment in Iraq: To build relationships with a town where U.S. bombs had killed twelve innocent people. But first he has to apologize to the families of those who were killed. We hear the apology, captured on tape by a journalist working in Iraq, and talk to Captain Gist about what things have been like since. (10 minutes)

      <description>How far will we go to get money? And once we've got it, what should we spend it on?

Marti Noxon used to work for a company that did &quot;product placement&quot; for the movie industry. When auditors came to check that clients were being correctly billed, the company's bosses took unusual steps. Namely, they hired actors to play the employees who were supposedly on the payroll. (7 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Five stories of people doing what they think they have to, in order to make ends meet. A suburban dad makes what seems like a rational choice (to him, at the time, anyway) to start robbing laundries and banks. A trader at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange describes how he got rich from the Chernobyl disaster. They all talked with Alex Kotlowitz. Amy Drozdowska-McGuire produced the stories. Versions of them first appeared on Chicago Public Radio's series Chicago Matters , which gets funding from the Chicago Community Trust. (29 minutes)
By Alex Kotlowitz

Act Two
Producer Diane Cook investigates that moment when you realize you've become &quot;that guy&quot; you've always hated, and how the simple act of purchasing deodorant can lead to that moment. (10 minutes)

      <description>Some librarians in Michigan embark on an audacious act of rebranding their libraries.

Kristy Kruger realized in college just how bad her high school education had been. She was always having to pretend she knew what the people around here were talking about when she didn't know.

      <description>Stories about the pitfalls of knowing just a little bit too little.

Host Ira Glass describes the thing that we all do at some point: Talk expertly about something we don't actually know anything about. It's so common, explains This American Life contributing editor Nancy Updike, that some friends of hers invented an imaginary magazine devoted to such blathering. It's called &quot;Modern Jackass.&quot; (4 minutes)
By Ira Glass Nancy Updike

Act One
This American Life producer Alex Blumberg investigates a little-studied phenomenon: Children who get a mistaken idea in their heads about how something works or what something means, and then don't figure out until well into adulthood that they were wrong. Includes the tale of a girl who received a tissue box for Christmas, allegedly painted by trained monkeys. (13 minutes)

      <description>The U.S. government spent two years on a sting operation trapping an Indian man named Hemant Lakhani.

The government had an almost impossible task after the September 11th attacks: They had to try to stop terrorists before they did anything — in some cases, before they even committed a crime. Dr. William Banks, a law professor and head of Syracuse University's Institute for National Security and Counterterrorism, talks about the difficulties of this mandate. (3 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Hemant Lakhani, an Indian-born British citizen, had been a salesman all his life. Clothing, rice, oil...it didn't matter to him what the product was, as long as he could spin a deal. Then one day, sitting in a hotel room with a gangster he happened to know, the phone rang. It was a business friend of the gangster's, calling from America. The man on the phone was rich, Lakhani was told. Maybe he would invest in Lakhani's latest venture. So Lakhani started talking to the man over the phone. Pretty soon they set up a meeting at a hotel in New Jersey, to talk business. But when Lakhani got there, the man seemed to be only interested in buying illegal weapons for Somali terrorists. Lakhani, always eager to make a deal, said he can help him out. What he didn't know, is that the supposed rich business man was an FBI informant, and that he had just walked into an elaborate government sting. Petra Bartosiewicz reports. (30 minutes)

By Ira Glass

Act One
The story of an Iranian couple who were unhappily married for 27 years. He had a temper. She never really loved him. So they split up, got divorced. And then, two years after that, to everybody's surprise, especially their grown-up children, they fell in love and married each other again. And this time, everything was different. One of their daughters, Nazanin Rafsanjani, tells the story. (25 1/2 minutes)

Song:“Someday My Prince Will Come” by Miles Davis

Act Two
Ralph and Sandra Fisher, who run a show-animal business in Texas, had a beloved Brahman bull named Chance. Chance was the gentlest bull they'd ever seen, more like a pet dog than a bull. They loved him, kids loved him. He had a long career in movies, on TV, performing at parties. When he finally died, Ralph and Cindy were devastated. Around that same time, scientists at Texas A&amp;M University were looking for animal subjects for a cloning project. They already had some tissue from Chance because they'd treated him for an illness. So Ralph and Cindy offered up Chance's DNA for the experiment. Second Chance was born. And he was, eerily, just like Chance. Except he wasn't. Which they found out the hard way. (21 minutes)

      <description>We spend an hour trying to remember why anyone liked the separation of church and state in the first place.

Two stories about people who suddenly realize they're the only ones around who value the separation of church and state. Paul Williams, a city councilman in Janesville, Wisconsin, wants to make sure a Salvation Army built with public money doesn't proselytize. Soon he's getting attacked in the local press...and by President Bush. And a Georgia teacher finds that by teaching what she's supposed to teach—evolution—she turns her school against her. (9 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
We hear a quick rundown of all the ways that Christian conservatives are making headway in advancing their values as public policy, why they think total separation of church and state is not what the founding fathers intended. And why they're wrong. On the Christian side of this argument is Pastor Russell Johnson of the Ohio Restoration Project , which is trying to recruit &quot;patriot pastors&quot; to get involved in state politics; and Bill Carrico, a Virgina legislator who's trying to make sure people can express their Christianity in schools and other public places. And then there are the videos and speeches of David Barton, whose group, Wallbuilders , is trying to teach people that the founding fathers meant for America to be a Christian country. On the other side are Rob Boston, spokesman for Americans United for Separation of Church and State , and Cornell government professor Isaac Kramnick, co-author of The Godless Constitution .

Prologue
As a kid, Aric Knuth sent cassette tapes to his dad, a merchant marine gone for months at a time. He’d leave one side blank and ask for a reply—but none ever came. Aric talks to Ira Glass about what it was like to finally ask his dad why. (7 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Lennard Davis was always told to avoid his no-good Uncle Abie. After his father died, Abie claimed he was actually Lenny’s biological father via artificial insemination. At first, the story seemed possible, then doubtful. It took Lenny more than 20 years to sort out whether it was true, and he finds out the answer—definitively—as tape is rolling. (31 minutes) Lennard Davis wrote a book about these experiences, called &quot; Go Ask Your Father .&quot;

      <description>Stories about people who end up making choices they'd rather not make, when their options begin to run out.

Host Ira Glass interviews Joe Amrine, who was falsely accused of murder. Rather than avoid the death penalty, Amrine said everything he could think of on the witness stand to get the jury to give him a death sentence. He figured that would be better than life in prison. Since he would need media attention and free legal help to appeal his case, he calculated the only way he could get it was to sit on death row, because nobody pays attention to lifers. He nearly was executed, and lived on death row for seventeen years before being released. (8 minutes) Joe's story is a part of the McSweeney's Voice of Witness Project —Oral Histories of Victims of Contemporary Human Rights Abuses and Social Injustices.
By Ira Glass

Act One
Dawna Lentz was a new employee at Quiznos sub shop in Seattle when the franchise owners just gave up. They stopped buying supplies, stopped answering their phones.

So she paid the other employees out of the cash register, and started scrounging to keep the place open. Shirleen Holt, a reporter for the Seattle Times , tells the story of how Dawna managed to stay afloat. (17 minutes)

But now that graduation is almost here, Muhammad thinks he might want to stay in America. On the other hand, he also misses his family terribly, and knows his parents will be heartbroken if he stays.

      <description>A dying mother makes a tape for her developmentally disabled daughter, hoping she'll watch it someday, knowing she might not.

Host Ira Glass talks to Laura Mayer, editor of the New Trier Township High School yearbook, about the renegade student who jumps into as many club photos as he can. And contributing editor Jack Hitt explains how this impulse—to be remembered as someone you're not—can be traced back to Benjamin Franklin. It turns out even the man who invented bifocals padded his resume for history. The key on the kite story, for instance?  Probably not true. (9 minutes)
By Jack Hitt

Act One
David Wilcox tells the story of how his mother, who was dying of lung cancer, made a short videotape for his sister, who is severely developmentally disabled. She hoped the tape would become a daily part of her daughter's life, like the other music and movies she liked to play, that she would watch it and remember her mother. But she also knew her daughter might never even see it. (9 minutes) And we hear two stories from people who recorded their own memories in a booth in Grand Central Station in New York, as part of the StoryCorps project. The first is Don &quot;Moses&quot; Lerman, a champion eater who's thought a lot about what he'll be remembered for. The second is Ronald Ruiz, a bus driver, who's never forgotten one of his passengers. StoryCorps funders include the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, National Public Radio, the Ford Foundation and the Open Society Institute. (3 minutes)
By David Wilcox

Act Two
Starlee Kine rents a room at a Ramada hotel in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, where a ghost supposedly plays pranks on the guests and staff. The ghost's name is Walter, for Walter Schroeder, the guy who originally built the hotel in the 1920s. It turns out Walter was a successful businessman and a kindly philanthropist who threw great dinner parties. So why would he bother haunting a Ramada? Starlee originally wrote and read a version of this story for The Little Gray Books Lecture Series . (14 minutes) And...two more stories about remembering, from StoryCorps. The first is a conversation between Ralph Tremonte and and Donald Weiss, who were in mental institutions together as kids, and are reunited after 40 years. The second is Brad Skow talking to his mother, Mary Lou Maher, who gave him up for adoption when she was 17. (4 minutes)

      <description>After four lawyers fail to get an innocent man out of prison, his friend takes on the case himself.

Carl King, a self-taught investigator, talks about the murder case he's working on now—one the police think they've already solved. Carl got started in this business after freeing his close friend from prison. He now runs an organization, called Success to Freedom , devoted to helping wrongfully convicted inmates. (2 minutes) This story was made into a film in 2017, called Crown Heights .
By Ira Glass

Act One
Reporter Anya Bourg tells the story of Carl King's first case, where he's able to accomplish what experienced detectives and lawyers were not. He proves that his friend was innocent. In this first half of the show, we hear the story of the crime. In 1980, Mario Hamilton was gunned down in the street in Brooklyn. A teenager claimed to have seen it happen. With police prompting, he fingered a guy named Collin Warner as the shooter. No matter that everyone in the neighborhood said someone else murdered Hamilton and that Warner had nothing to do with it. And no matter that the teenager hadn't witnessed the murder at all. A jury convicted Warner, and he was sentenced to 15 years to life for killing a man he'd never even heard of. Carl, his childhood friend couldn't let it rest, and started to fight the conviction. He tells everyone he can about the case. He tracks down witnesses. He teaches himself to read court documents. Eventually, he gets a real estate lawyer hooked on the case. (29 minutes)

      <description>Sometimes, getting your big break isn't all it's cracked up to be.

Host Ira Glass tells the story of Marisela and Yadira, who were honors students in high school. They wanted to go to the best colleges, but they couldn't get federally-funded scholarships because they weren't U.S. citizens; they had come from Mexico when they were little. Through a series of fortunate breaks, they manage to scrape together enough money to go to college. Still, because of their illegal status, they have no idea if their education will get them anywhere in America. Helen Thorpe, a reporter in Denver, interviewed the students. (6 minutes)
By Helen Thorpe

Act One
Charlie Brill and Mitzi McCall were a comedy duo back in the mid-1960s, playing clubs around Los Angeles, when their agent called to tell them he'd landed them the gig of a lifetime: They were going to be on The Ed Sullivan Show .

      <description>What life is like for American soldiers in Iraq.

Host Ira Glass talks to Tom Irwin, a stand-up comic who recently performed for American troops all around Iraq for over a month. It seems his best joke, about Iraqi sheep farmers, only makes sense if you're a soldier on deployment. Irwin's one-man show about his trip is called &quot;25 Days in Iraq.&quot; (2 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
When an Arkansas National Guard Unit is sent off to Iraq, they assume they're going to help rebuild the country, since they're trained as an engineering unit. But once they arrive, they find themselves in a combat zone, unprepared and ill-equipped. Their trucks, for instance, are from the 1950s and 1960s. The unit's story is told in a documentary television series Off to War , which is on the Discovery Times cable channel. Ira interviews the filmmakers, Brent and Craig Renaud, and talks to a few of the guardsmen still stationed north of Baghdad. We also hear clips from the documentary. The series is produced by DCTV in New York. (39 minutes)

By Ira Glass

Act One
Ira spends hours talking to James Hackett, known to his friends, and by the end of the story, to Ira, as Gig. He's a doctor in Cincinnati and a lifelong Republican. But he hates President Bush. Pretty much hates everything he's done since taking office. Over several months, he sways from Kerry to Bush and back again, sometimes with Ira's help, before coming to a final decision—one that probably surprises even him. (18 minutes)

Act One
Washington Irving Elementary School became a model of school reform in Chicago a decade ago. The school did it without adding a ton more money. It wasn't a magnet school or charter school. Their strategy: Get the kids to enjoy reading and writing, get them glasses if they need them, give teachers control of their classrooms. Scores climbed. Teachers like Cathy were happy. Students actually liked coming to school. We hear excerpts from Ira's 1994 All Things Considered series about the school. (21 minutes)

Behind enemy lines, sometimes people get confused about whose side they're on and how to fight the enemy.  (2 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
In this election year, one question is rarely asked in a very direct way: Is the Bush Administration competent at conducting the war on terror? Every few weeks it seems like there's more news about how badly it's going: Senior Administration officials like Colin Powell now admit the insurgency in Iraq is growing; terror suspects like Yasir Hamdi (who supposedly were so dangerous that having a lawyer talk to them about their case would compromise national security) are released without trial because the evidence against them is so flimsy; there was the Abu Ghraib prison scandal; and just this week, the former head of the U.S. operation in Iraq, Paul Bremer, declared the problem from the start was that there were not enough troops there. Host Ira Glass discusses whether the Bush Administration is simply not very skilled at fighting terror with Richard Perle and James Fallows. Perle was one of the early advocates in Administration circles of going to war in Iraq. During the run-up to the war, he was chairman of the Defense Policy Board, a civilian advisory panel in the Pentagon. Fallows is national correspondent for The Atlantic Monthly , who has written extensively on the planning and early problems in the war in Iraq. (14 minutes)

Song:“I Give Up” by Quasi

Act Two
Patrick Wall was a special kind of monk. He was a fixer. The Catholic church sent him to problem parishes where priests had been removed because of scandal. His job was to come in, keep events from going public, and smooth things over until a permanent replacement priest was found. But after four different churches in four years, after covering up for pedophiles and adulterers and liars and embezzlers, he decided to make a change. Carl Marziali tells his story. Read the statement from St. John's Monastery on sex abuse by their monks. Also, visit the website of the Survivor's Network of Those Abused by Priests. (21 minutes)
By Carl Marziali

Act Three
You can divide all living creatures into two camps. We humans are in one camp, along with lots of other things like dogs and birds and trees and caterpillars. In the other camp are the things that live inside of us, the bacterias and viruses, the worms and protozoans, in short, parasites. Scientists estimate that the parasites outnumber us and our free-living allies by 3 to 1. Carl Zimmer, author of the book Parasite Rex , talks with Ira about how parasites manage the trick of living inside of us, behind enemy lines, without us finding out. (9 minutes)

      <description>Stories about people deciding whether to give it their all.

When you're in school, you're supposed to be a Renaissance person — do art, literature, sports, music—and be enthusiastic about it all. You get graded for effort. When we grow up, we're expected to transfer that give-it-your-all attitude into our adult lives, into situations where it doesn't really belong. Take Kenneth. He works as a greeter at a restaurant. (4 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Hilary Hoffman wanted to give up his nine-to-five urban life. So he convinced his wife they could make it as organic farmers in rural Pennsylvania. It hasn't been going so well. The deer eat his vegetables. Weeds are strangling his strawberries. His muscles are constantly sore. Plus, he's just not a morning person. So This American Life arranges for him to get a makeover, agricultural style. George DeVault, a writer and editor at Rodale's New Farm magazine, who has his own organic farm , comes to the rescue. Shea Dean helped produce this story. (19 minutes)

      <description>We leave behind the official Republican talking points and ask them to speak instead about what they actually believe.

Writer Thomas Frank went on the radio show On Point to talk about his book What's the Matter With Kansas? The book is about how people in his home state keep voting for Republicans even though Republican policies aren't helping them economically. But the people who called in to the radio show didn't exactly see it his way. (6 minutes)

      <description>Stories about adults struggling to figure out what is in the best interest of some child.

Colin Dunn had an A average as an eighth grader, and he was in a program for gifted kids. But he hated school. The spring before he graduated, he figured out that if he simply stopped going to school for the rest of the year, he'd still graduate with a B average. So that's what he did. Host Ira Glass talks to Colin and his dad, Corey, who had to deal with Colin's rebellion. (7 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
The story of Colin's truancy continues. The whole thing was especially awkward for his dad, because he's a behavior specialist for 100 public schools in Oregon—including Colin's school. Corey wanted his son to go back, but he also knew how awful school can be for some kids. (6 minutes)

Act Two
Some family legends are most notable for their absence. They're too disturbing or scandalous to tell. Kevin O'Leary's family specialized in those.

When he finds out, his family's reaction is almost as shocking as the story itself. (23 minutes)

The private security guys (from a company called Custer Battles) who guard Baghdad International Airport usually get along fine with the U.S. military personnel stationed there—except when Nancy happened to be taping, and a huge fight broke out. (7 minutes)
By Nancy Updike

Act Two
A former military man, Hank was hired by Custer Battles to clean up one of its other Iraq operations, guarding businessmen. He has a very clear idea of who he wants working for him: &quot;flat-bellied, steely-eyed professionals.&quot; Instead, he's trying to tighten up a outfit whose workers once engaged in an extended firefight at a Baghdad hotel—against each other. (19 minutes)
By Nancy Updike

Act Five
Karen Hahn, who works for Custer Battles at the airport, started out there screening women passengers—and learned a lot from their handbags. Unlike most people Nancy met in Iraq, Karen is not a former military person, she doesn't work with guns or big machines, and she's never been happier in her life. (3 minutes)
By Nancy Updike

Act Six
Hundred of Iraqi police officers have been killed since the United States invaded Iraq. One Boston cop, Jerry Burke, is trying to keep them on the job, and train them in Western police practices. Besides rogue officers, not having enough guns and bullet-proof vests, and men refusing to go on patrols, it's going OK. He's also having a hard time setting up his driver with his translator.

The attempted sabotage operation was chronicled in Washington Post reporter Michael Dobbs's excellent book, Saboteurs: The Nazi Raid on America . (36 minutes)

      <description>Sarah Vowell explains the cheerful journalism of deprivation. And other stories.

It's hard to give things up. Host Ira Glass tells the story of Walter, a three-year-old boy who had to give up his pacifier, and then, wanting comfort, asked all the adults around him to tell the stories of when they gave up their pacifiers. (4 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Nubar Alexanian was forced to give up one thing—and then gave up another thing by choice. This story was put together by Nubar and his daughter Abby, with help from Jay Allison , for Transom.org , with funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. It originally appeared on Transom's site.
By Nubar Alexanian

Act Two
Sarah Vowell introduces you to a magazine that—if you're lucky—you've never had to read. A magazine called Living Without. Her story is part of the Hearing Voices project, which gets funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. (6 minutes) Note: In 2011, we redid this show , replacing Sarah's essay with something else. Her essay is great, but the culture sort of caught up to the idea of gluten-free living and by the time we wanted to rerun the show six years after it was first broadcast, in an era where pizza places everywhere offer gluten free pizza, the story felt like a relic from a more innocent, gluten-ignorant era.
By Sarah Vowell
Song:“Without You” by Mariah Carey

Act Three
Every week, Chelsea Merz has lunch with a homeless man named Matthew, in the same restaurant. Matthew's been on the street for seven years, but once or twice a year, he housesits for a friend. She talked to him after he was housesitting for 16 days, on the day he went back out on the street. This story is part of a larger project Chelsea is putting together, with help from Jay Allison, the Cape and Island NPR stations, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. (8 minutes)

When Hyder was 17, he went to Afghanistan. This place that he'd been hearing about his whole life. And he took a tape recorder with him. Then the next summer he went back.

Nauru is a tiny island, population 12,000, a third of the size of Manhattan and far from anywhere: Yet at the center of several of the decade's biggest global events. Contributing editor Jack Hitt tells the untold story of this dot in the middle of the Pacific and its involvement in the bankrupting of the Russian economy, global terrorism, North Korean defectors, the end of the world, and the late 1980s theatrical flop of a London musical based on the life of Leonardo da Vinci called Leonardo, A Portrait of Love .

      <description>We follow the trash from the sanitation men on the street, to the mob guys who controlled the hauling business, to the people who actually live in dumps.

Every day each American produces 4.8 pounds of garbage. Where does it all go? Ira talks with Robin Nagle, a anthropology professor at New York University who's been studying garbage,and says that most of us want garbage to be invisible. Which, usually, it is. (4 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
The people who pick up our trash don't call themselves garbagemen. They're san men (&quot;san&quot; being short for &quot;sanitation&quot;). Host Ira Glass follows a couple of New York city san men around for a day (with NYU's Robin Nagle, who's writing about about the san men), to find out what 4.8 pounds of trash per person per day looks like from street level. (12 minutes)

This is just fine with Luis's fourteen-year-old son, who goes with him.

      <description>David Rakoff guest hosts.

David Rakoff tells a story from when he was a kid, about the day he realized the he would inevitably be viewed a certain way by his classmates, no matter what he did or said. (7 minutes)
By David Rakoff

Act One
For four hours in August 2001, KCAL-9, an all-news channel in Los Angeles, broadcast a very unusual police pursuit. The suspect drove under the speed limit, obeyed all traffic laws, signaled every time he wanted to turn. For the first three hours he's followed by a slow speed line of police cars, but for the last hour, he's driving alone—the police have called off the chase and are simply waiting for him to run out of gas. Producer Starlee Kine reports on the world's slowest car chase. (23 minutes)
By Starlee Kine

Act Two
When you get to know someone, really know them, you can almost predict their behavior. It's comforting, this intimacy. But what about when something comes up that requires people to transcend their character? Sheila Peabody tells the story of a moment when every single member of her family played their part as expected—with tragic circumstances. (10 minutes)
By Sheila Peabody

Act Three
A lot of life's inevitability is hazy; it'll happen some time, but you're not sure when. But with pregnancy, it's on an invariable schedule: forty weeks. Producer Wendy Dorr is currently at week thirty-six. She is experiencing an essential contradiction of pregnancy, which is the thing she is most looking forward to is also the thing that scares her. David Rakoff accompanies her to her Lamaze class to find out how you prepare for an inevitability that's on a fixed timetable. (5 minutes)

We hear Billie Holliday, Keely Smith and Leo Reisman (with Anita Boyer) asking the musical question, &quot;What Is This Thing Called Love?&quot; And, reporter Sean Cole talks about love with Joe and Helen Garland, who fell in love during World War II, but married other people. Thirty years later they met again, felt the same love they felt when they were young, divorced their respective spouses, and finally married each other. (6 minutes)

Act Two
An act named after two TV shows, one where women sit around and talk, the other where men sit around and talk. If men are from Mars and women are from Venus, when you switch from one planet to another, what do you need to know about love? We hear from several transsexual men who've done exactly that. They were born as women, became men with the help of modern medical science, and had to re-learn how to love on the other side of the gender line. Griffin Hansbury reports. (22 minutes)

      <description>Stories of very unusual pen pals, people whose relationship could not exist without the help of the postal service.

Ira talks to historian Ted Widmer about two of the first pen pals in the New World. John Winthrop and Roger Williams were both Puritans in Massachusetts in the 1630s. Then Roger Williams was banished for suggesting the revolutionary idea that there should be separation between church and state. John Winthrop was the Governor of Massachusetts, which exiled him.  But the two men somehow stayed friends, writing letters long after Williams was sent away. (6 minutes)
By Ira Glass

      <description>Four real stories in which real people invent amazingly clever solutions to their problems.

Host Ira Glass reminds the audience about the old TV series MacGyver , about the guy who stops bad guys without a gun. He uses science and sheer ingenuity to invent solutions. Then Ira interviews This American Life contributing editor Sarah Vowell, who lives in New York, about how, even in the middle of the biggest power failure in the history of the U.S., it's hard for an average citizen to exercise MacGyveresque ingenuity. (4 minutes)

      <description>Stories about what the passage of time can do to someone.

Host Ira Glass plays parts of a speech by George Ryan, former Governor of Illinois. When he was a state senator in 1977, Ryan was part of a successful coalition that voted to reinstate the death penalty in Illinois. Two decades later, he became governor and had to make the final decision in state capital cases—cases which he'd helped bring about 20 years earlier. He found that the death penalty looks a lot different when you're the one who bears final responsibility for whether someone lives or dies. (5 minutes)

      <description>The story of a fixer for the Catholic Church and how he came to sympathize with the people that he was sent to deceive.

Host Ira Glass tells the enemy camp story the way we like it to be told. (2 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Patrick Wall was a special kind of monk. He was a fixer. The Catholic Church sent him to problem parishes where priests had been removed because of scandal. His job was to come in, keep events from going public and smooth things over until a permanent replacement priest was found. But after four different churches in four years, after covering up for pedophiles and adulterers and liars and embezzlers he decided to make a change. Carl Marziali tells his story. You can read the statement from St. John's Monastery on sex abuse by their monks, and see the website of the Survivor's Network of Those Abused by Priests . (21 minutes)
By Carl Marziali

Act Two
You can divide all living creatures into two camps. We humans are in one camp, along with lots of other things like dogs and birds and trees and caterpillars. In the other camp are the things that live inside of us, the bacterias and viruses, the worms and protozoans, in short, parasites. Scientists estimate that the parasites outnumber us and our free-living allies by 3 to 1. Carl Zimmer, author of the book Parasite Rex , talks with Ira about how parasites manage the trick of living inside of us, behind enemy lines, without us finding out. (11 minutes)

      <description>Jonathan Goldstein and Starlee Kine go to a karaoke club that has, along with all the songs, comedy routines for people to perform.

Host Ira Glass talks with producer Alex Blumberg about going on a date with a woman from Russia. Even though she spoke perfect English, the night was a misunderstanding, because they each had different ideas of what is meant by the words &quot;good date.&quot; (7 minutes)
By Alex Blumberg

Act One
Why is it that karaoke machines only have songs on them? If what they do is take a version of a public performance and allow the rest of us to give our own interpretations of the material, why aren't there other options, like the &quot;you talkin to me?&quot; scene from Taxi Driver , or Martin Luther King, Jr.'s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech. Jonathan Goldstein and producer Starlee Kine find out why when they go to a karaoke club that has, along with all the songs, comedy routines for people to perform. (11 minutes)

      <description>Stories of regime change in everyday life.

Host Ira Glass talks with This American Life producer Julie Snyder about a personal regime change that happened when she was a kid, after her parents got divorced and her stepdad came on the scene. She says that by the time her parents separated, literature on what to tell the children was everywhere, and the kids took it relatively well. But her parents were less clear on how to introduce their new partners. And trying to fit a new stepdad into the picture was actually much more traumatic to Julie than dealing with the divorce.

For many years, Israeli citizens learned a sanitized version of what happened during their War of Independence in 1948. They learned that 700,000 Arabs fled the country on their own accord. But in the late 1980s, a group of Israeli historians gained access to most of the government documents from the war and started writing a truer, less flattering version of the story: That in some cases, the Palestinians were forced out, or scared away, and then not allowed to return. Ira discusses the real history and its impact on the Israeli public with some of the men who uncovered it: Benny Morris, author of The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem 1947-1949 , and Tom Segev, who wrote 1949: The First Israelis . He also talks to BZ Goldberg, one of the filmmakers behind the Emmy-winning documentary about Israeli and Palestinian kids, called Promises . (20 minutes)

      <description>Stories of sudden truths delivered by complete strangers.

Host Ira Glass talks with Michael Beaumier, who runs the personals section of the Chicago Reader , and who functions as a kind of guardian angel for many of the singles who advertise in his paper. (7 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
The story of one girl's mission to bring people together everywhere by eliminating small talk forever. This American Life producer Starlee Kine has been going around lecturing audiences on the subject. She encourages them to switch to a new system she's invented, called The Rundown. Recorded at The Little Gray Book Lectures at the Galapagos Art Space in New York City. Thanks to Sheila Heti and the Trampoline Hall Lecture Series. (6 minutes)
By Starlee Kine

Act Two
Jessica Riddle reports on how, as a teenager, she and her friends would pick up the phone and dial the letters of the name &quot;Heather&quot; and talk to the old man who'd pick up the phone. At first they'd just prank call him. But then it turned out to be much more. (18 minutes)

      <description>A California teenager returns to the home country he's never known.

In January 2002-- not long after the Taliban were driven from power in Afghanistan-- he came to the United States, partly to be on hand for the State of the Union address last year. And while he was here, he spoke with an audience that was mostly Afghan-Americans at Georgetown University. And he said to them, in Pashto and then in English, come back. Come back to Afghanistan. He directed this especially to the young people. (3 minutes)

      <description>Stories of some of the secrets our government keeps: of imprisonment, deportation, and spying.

We hear a brief clip of host Ira Glass talking to John Podesta, who as chief of staff under President Clinton helped institute that administration's policy of declassifying as many documents possible. The Bush administration's philosophy is very different. Ira runs through a list of new secrets in the federal government. (3 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
There are at least two American citizens being held without charges, unable to see lawyers, in military jails in the U.S. There may be more. Jack Hitt tried to find out everything he could about one of them: Jose Padilla, who will stay confined to a brig in South Carolina &quot;until the end of the war,&quot; according to the White House. (17 minutes)
By Jack Hitt

Act Two
In the war on terror, the government is rounding up foreigners, checking their immigration status, and then, sometimes, deporting them. It won't give out their names. David Kestenbaum tried to find out everything that can be found out about who these new deportees are...and about what happened to them once they were seized and put on trial, in secret. To do this, he has to bypass the federal government (which won't say much about the deportees) and head overseas to talk with them firsthand. (18 minutes)

      <description>We still have some basic questions about why we're going to war and whether it's a good thing.

Host Ira Glass tells the story of a report by the U.S. intelligence community back in October 2002 that declared that the likelihood of Saddam Hussein using weapons of massive destruction was very low for the &quot;foreseeable future&quot;...unless the U.S. were to launch a military attack on Iraq. In other words, the war to stop him from using weapons of mass destruction would probably cause the thing it was designed to prevent. Ira talks with Senator Bob Graham, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, who asked the intelligence community to do this risk assessment, and who was surprised it didn't have more effect on the public debate over the war. Before he and Ira get off the phone, the Senator asks Ira to please pose a few questions about the intelligence report to the Administration for him. (7 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Ira speaks with Gordon Jondroe of the newly-created Department of Homeland Security, trying to get answers to Senator Graham's questions. It doesn't go so well. (5 minutes)
By Ira Glass
Song:“Mean Old World” by Sam Cooke

Act Two
For an Iraqi perspective on the war, we hear from Iraqis who've just crossed over the border into Jordan. It's the only open border with Iraq and 150,000 Iraqis live in Amman. Reporter Adam Davidson talks with a soldier who'll probably fight in the war against the United States, a man who claims he was one of Saddam Hussein's bodyguards and knows locations of hidden chemical weapons in Iraq. (18 minutes)
By Adam Davidson

Act Three
It's possible that the most compelling arguments against the war with Iraq, and the most compelling arguments for the war with Iraq, are arguments you've never heard. Ira talks with journalist Nicholas Lemann from The New Yorker magazine about two ways of seeing the war:  The so-called Hawks' view, and the so-called Realists' view. His article about all this is called &quot;The War on What?&quot; Two of the Realists, Stephen Van Evera from M.I.T. and Stephen Walt of Harvard, lay out their surprising case against the war. Arguing a very persuasive case against them is Kenneth Pollack, of the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, who was a Persian Gulf military analyst for seven years at the CIA (including during the Persian Gulf War) and after that for the National Security Council under President Clinton. He wrote a book called The Threatening Storm: the Case for Invading Iraq. (19 minutes)

      <description>Stories of people stuck in moments that they revisit over and over again.

Host Ira Glass talks with Starlee Kine, who loves TV reruns more than first-run shows. She explains that even if it's a show she hates— Caroline in the City for example—she'll watch the rerun. The simple fact that it's a rerun makes it, not better exactly, but comforting in a way first-run shows aren't. (6 minutes)
By Starlee Kine

Act One
Starlee Kine tells the story of a man more obsessed with reruns than even she is. Director Trent Harris made a movie called The Beaver Trilogy . It's an entire movie that's a rerun, based on a personal rerun that Trent found himself caught in. Starlee saw the movie, and tells the remarkable story of why it was made. (27 minutes)
By Starlee Kine

Act Two
Many couples eventually encounter this problem: One person in the couple trots out the same story over and over, and the other person has to just listen. But what do the stories we tell in front of our significant others mean, and what do the significant others really think of them? Ira talks to three couples about the stories they've each told and heard countless times, and why. One couple is John Hodgman and his wife Catherine Hodgman. Another couple is RadioLab co-host Robert Krulwich and his wife Tamar Krulwich. (16 minutes) Robert and Tamar's story, which involves Jackie Kennedy Onassis, was also illustrated by Chris Ware and animated by John Kuramoto for our television show.

      <description>Home movies are often all the same—kids on the beach, people getting married, birthday parties—so why do we make and watch so many of them?

Host Ira Glass talks with filmmaker Alan Berliner, who for six years collected old home movies he found at thrift stores and garage sales. He says that almost all of them document either rites of passage, like birthdays and weddings, or moments of leisure—the beach is especially big. They show our lives as we'd want them to look, but maybe not as they actually do. Alan Berliner's movie, which he made from his six years of collected video, is called Family Album . (5 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Jonathan Goldstein made every girl he ever dated watch the home movie of his family's Rosh Hashanah dinner he made when he was 17. He hoped that seeing his family life on film might make the women more sympathetic to his shortcomings. In this story, for the first time, Jonathan shares the Rosh Hashanah video with a national audience. Jonathan's most recent book is I'll Seize the Day Tomorrow (13 minutes)
By Jonathan Goldstein
Song:“You Talk Too Much” by Run-DMC

Act Two
From the time he was a little kid until the time he graduated high school, Darren Stein made movies with his father's video camera. The cast was composed of friends from his street, a suburban cul-de-sac in Encino, California. The sets were their various backyards. The production schedule was every day after school, and all day in the summer. They shot horror movies, action flicks, and even a musical called &quot;I Have No Friends,&quot; which Darren wrote soon after being transferred to a new junior high school. Darren is now a real director in Hollywood. Ira talked with him and his frequent childhood leading man, Adam Schell, about what the movies meant to them as kids. Darren and Adam made a documentary about their childhood moviemaking called Put the Camera on Me . (12 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act Three
The TV show America's Funniest Home Videos has an archive of over half-a-million video clips. Ira talks with Todd Thicke, the show's co-executive producer, and Trace Beaulieu and Mike Palleschi, two of the show's writers, about what all that footage tells them about Americans that the rest of us don't know. (5 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act Four
Home movies usually don't have much of a plot—one of the many ways they differ from Hollywood movies. But reporter Susan Burton has a lifetime of home movies, which together describe a very Hollywood plot, about how she remade herself from a friendless nerd into a popular girl. (12 minutes)

      <description>&quot;Hi, middleman. Here are three splendid acts to toast your subtle virtues.&quot;

Host Ira Glass talks with Chris, who worked for a company that helped deaf people talk over the phone with hearing people. The deaf person would type what they wanted Chris to say, and Chris would say it, then type back the response from the hearing person on the line. As the man in the middle, Chris was privy to intimate moments in people's lives. He was the middleman on drug deals, breakups. Occasionally, desperate mothers would appeal to him directly to talk sense to their stubborn deaf children with words that they themselves did not possess. As the job wore on, Chris found it more and more impossible to just be a neutral go-between. (7 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
You can't do a program about middlemen without a story about business. In this act, we hear from a man who made his living buying low and selling high...incredibly high, sometimes at mark-ups of up to 1,000 percent. In the 1990s, when Michael Jordan led the Bulls, &quot;X&quot; took to the streets of Chicago scalping tickets and making what he refers to nostalgically as &quot;phat money.&quot; (20 minutes)
By Alex Blumberg
Song:“Two Tickets to Paradise” by Eddie Money

Act Two
Sal Princiatta is a New York fireman whose unit lost a lot of men on September 11th. Beth Landau was a friend of Sal's, and a couple months ago, she orchestrated a trip to Memphis for Sal and the other guys at the firehouse. She thought it would take their minds off things. In Memphis, they were cheered and feted everywhere they went. People asked for autographs, gave them gifts. Sal realized that as New York fireman, he and his colleagues were acting as a very particular and unusual kind of middleman for the people they met. This story was put together with the help of Lumiere Productions in New York City. (9 minutes)

      <description>We take the classifieds from one Sunday edition of the paper and fill a program with stories that come from the ads.

Host Ira Glass talks with Marion Tanios, a classified section editor at the Chicago Sun-Times . She explains that if the news section of the newspaper gives you the public life of a city, the classified section gives you a sense of people's personal lives. We take a quick tour through the classified section: &quot;Wedding Dress for sale, never worn;&quot; &quot;Agoraphobics in Motion, A.I.M. meet weekly;&quot; and a house sale where an old woman heading to a nursing home is selling off her belongings. (7 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
&quot;Stolen Dog, black, toy poodle named Isis.&quot; Producer Todd Bachmann interviews a man named Leo, who recently placed that ad. Leo was planning to breed Isis with his other dog, Button, a Shitzu, and make a new breed which he planned to call &quot;Shidoodle.&quot; (7 minutes)

Song:“Isis” by Bob Dylan

Act Two

Act Three
Sometimes in the classified ads one person will be seeking something that another person will be offering. This is especially true of the musicians section of the classifieds, where there might be a drummer seeking a band, and on the same page, a band seeking a drummer. We play matchmaker and form a one-day band out of the musicians in the classifieds. Producer Starlee Kine tells what happens, with the help of Jon Langford, a musician who already has a band, the Mekons, who are celebrating their 25th anniversary in rock and roll, and whose most recent album is OOOH! (Out of Our Heads) . (15 minutes)

      <description>Some people have a rather dark worldview that divides people into two groups: Suckers and non-suckers.

Host Ira Glass talks with Adam and Wendy, a couple whose world view was changed when they bought a house. Adam and Wendy were the kind of people who believed that most people by and large were good, and their motives by and large honest. But when they found that the former owner had lied about all sorts of things in their new house, they were reluctantly forced to change their view of things. The former owners were the types who believed in suckering the other guy before he suckers you, and now Adam and Wendy were starting to think that way too. (7 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Jen's mom Sheila does things like this: She buys a brand name at a discount store, and then returns it to a fancy store for a full refund. She thinks you're a sucker if you don't take advantage of opportunities like that. Jen admires her mom's chutzpah, but can't do the things she does, so her mom tries to teach her...on tape. Jen pins a hidden microphone on herself, and she and her mother try and return a gift Burberry sweater to the actual Burberry store. (15 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act Two
Rarely when we're suckered do we get a chance at revenge, and that turns out to be a good thing. Writer Shane DuBow tells the story of a scam he fell for when he was just out of college. Twelve years later, the same guys tried the same scam on him. But getting even wasn't as easy as he thought. (11 minutes)
By Shane DuBow

Act Three
There's a whole nation where the idea of suckerdom permeates almost every aspect of culture and politics. Adam Davidson reports on the Israeli word &quot;freier,&quot; which literally translates as sucker, but means much, much more. (7 minutes)

      <description>Stories of people traveling under false identities, not for power or personal gain, but for their own deeper personal reasons.

Host Ira Glass talks with Erin Einhorn, a reporter for the Philadelphia Daily News , who went to Poland to find the Catholic family that had sheltered and saved her mother from the Nazi concentration camps during World War II. She found that in Krakow where she was living, in a country where Jewish populations had been vilified and then exterminated by the Nazis, Judaism was suddenly trendy. (5 minutes)

      <description>The pros and cons of the hormone of desire.

Producer Alex Blumberg explains that he wanted to do this show because of his conflicted relationship with his own testosterone. He tells host Ira Glass that the reasons go back to a girl in his eighth-grade homeroom and the 1970s seminal feminist novel The Women's Room. We also hear from a man who stopped producing testosterone due to a medical treatment and found that his entire personality was altered. (9 minutes)
By Alex Blumberg Ira Glass

Act One
The interview with a man who lost his testosterone continues. He explains that life without testosterone is life without desire—desire for everything: food, conversation, even TV. And he says life without desire is unexpectedly pleasant. The man first wrote about his experiences, anonymously, in GQ Magazine. (8 minutes)

      <description>What happened after a group of Native American girls from one town found themselves being chased down the highway by a group of white boys from another town.

Host Ira Glass talks to Cory Simmons and Dominique Mapp, who were driving home one night and were followed by a group of rowdy men in an SUV. The men tailed them for miles and then started firing a gun at them. When Cory and Dominique finally made it to a police station, it turned out that the men in the car were all drunk, white, off-duty policemen. Cory and Dominique are black. When the case came to trial, the cops weren't convicted of anything—not assault, not attempted murder, not even disorderly conduct. (9 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Reporter Susan Burton tells the story of a high-speed chase in South Dakota. An incident at a high school basketball game escalated to the point where a group of Native American girls from one town found themselves being chased down the highway by a group of white boys from another town. The boys were brandishing a shotgun and firing it into the air. What happened in the months that followed after police got involved and charges were filed didn't seem fair to either side. Susan begins the story by talking about the incident with the girls. For Native Americans, the event fit into what they see as a decades-long—or maybe centuries-long—pattern of injustice. And the event traumatized the girls so much that in the months after, one of them underwent an almost complete personality transformation, and another became suicidal. (22 minutes)

      <description>A group of inmates at a high-security prison stage a production of the last act of Hamlet.

Host Ira Glass surveys various productions of Hamlet being staged around the country: At community colleges in Brooklyn and Honolulu, on a professional stage in Boston, and at a Shakespeare camp for kids in San Francisco—where all the scenes are death scenes. (3 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Jack Hitt begins his story about a group of prisoners at the Missouri Eastern Correctional Center who are rehearsing and staging a production of Hamlet . The man who plays Hamlet gets in character by recalling times he's wanted to hurt people, like the crime that sent him to prison, in which he shot two people and left them for dead. Big Hutch, who plays Horatio, explains how it would work if you set Hamlet in a prison, and why it would actually improve a flaw in the plot. You can see video clips of the Prison Performing Arts performances online. (30 minutes)

      <description>Two years after the Mideast peace process collapsed, we wanted to understand what that has done to people living in Israel and the West Bank.

Ira visits the border where Israel meets the West Bank and finds it's more like Scottsdale, Arizona, than he ever expected. We also hear from Tel Aviv advertising writer Erez Hadary, who created a bumper sticker that expresses Israeli confusion right now; from Rula Hamadani, a Palestinian who's feeling just as confused; and from journalist and historian Tom Segev (author of 1949: The First Israelis , Elvis in Jerusalem , and other books) about some very odd Israeli poll numbers. (5 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Nancy Updike reports that life under curfew in Ramallah can be, among other things, intensely boring. She also tells the story of Sam Bahour, a Palestinian who was born and raised in Ohio, who came back to the West Bank in 1995, when peace seemed possible, to help build the Palestinian state. Now he can't leave his house. (13 minutes)
By Nancy Updike

Act Two
Ira Glass travels through Israel with Adam Davidson, who speaks Hebrew and has countless Israeli cousins and other family members. They find that the entire country has moved to the right in reaction to Palestinian violence. (26 minutes)

      <description>Ira Glass goes to a fake wedding at a home for Alzheimer's patients.

Host Ira Glass goes to a fake wedding at a home for Alzheimer's patients in Davenport, Iowa. Two high school kids who've never even kissed are the bride and groom. Most of the residents couldn't tell you either of their names. But the staff of the Country House residence stages the event because it makes the residents happy...even if they won't remember it by dinnertime. (3 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
The story from the prologue continues, with the groom who refused to be a groom, and the one person who'll probably remember the fake wedding, namely, the fake bride. (6 minutes)

Song:“Time Enough for Rocking When We're Old” by The Magnetic Fields

Act Two
A fable of how America got its name, and how it was named after someone who was a fraud, but the kind of fraud people love, the kind of fraud who knows how to please a crowd. Jack Hitt tells the racy and little-known story of how Amerigo Vespucci got his name all over the map of the western hemisphere by telling lies about what he found there—the type of lies which can be found today in the pages of Penthouse magazine. (13 minutes)

Act Three
Milton Reid works as a freelance muralist in one of the largest housing projects in America, Chicago's Robert Taylor Homes. For fifty to two hundred dollars, he'll paint a mural on a resident's living room wall, or in their kitchen, or in the bathroom. He explains that when he first started, all his clients wanted were black and gold panthers, but their tastes have gotten more varied. (8 minutes)
By Amy Dorn

Act Four
Ali Davis literally hands people their fantasies, in her job at a Chicago video store with a huge porn section. She tells true stories about what the job is like. (10 minutes)

      <description>Stories about people who turned to the experts and got horrible advice.

Host Ira Glass talks with NPR's Car Talk hosts Tom and Ray Maggliozi and a former employee of theirs, Joe Richman. Ray once fixed Joe's beloved '72 Plymouth Valiant, a repair job which hastened it to its grave...but probably got Joe a girlfriend. Tom and Ray discuss how common it is for car experts to screw up a repair. (6 minutes)
By Ira Glass Tom and Ray Maggliozi

Act One
Alix Spiegel reports on the &quot;Recovered Memory&quot; movement. In the early 1990s people across America turned to experts in psychology for help...and many people were told that the source of their problems could be traced to traumatic events they could not even remember, to memories that had to be recovered through special techniques. In the last ten years, this whole approach to psychology has fallen out of favor. So what happened that so many experts came to believe in a treatment that turned out to make many of their patients worse, not better...and what happened when the patients and therapists figured all this out?

      <description>We take the laws of physics and apply them to the realm of human relationships.

We hear two stories of everyday life which are more easily understood if one knows some of the laws of physics, specifically the Mediocrity Principle and the Casimir Effect. Then particle physicist and Senior Editor David Kestenbaum explains why physicists hate it when non-scientists try to apply these laws and principles to their daily lives. (7 minutes)
By Ira Glass David Kestenbaum

Act One
In Los Angeles, Cris Beam reports on a family named the Paladinos that had a theory that explained their lives. And then, at some point, that theory came to seem inadequate. It didn't seem to match the data and evidence at hand. So they switched to a different theory. Cris Beam’s latest book is I Feel You: The Surprising Power of Extreme Empathy .
By Cris Beam

Act Two
Jon Ronson tells the story of how his parents decided to commission a family portrait, and how things went awry because of the brilliant but troubled local artist they hired for the job. In the story, Jon circles in a reluctant orbit around his parents, and his parents are in a rather energetic orbit of their own. Jon’s new podcast series is Things Fell Apart: Eight Strange Tales from the Culture Wars . (13 minutes)

      <description>Stories of people who try to convince you that the devil is there, whispering in your ear.

How does the Devil work? We hear stories from five different people who say they found themselves inexplicably doing something random and bad, something which made no sense to them at all. Host Ira Glass explains why this might be, cadging a bit from C.S. Lewis's The Screwtape Letters . (11 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Trinity Church in Texas puts on something called Hell House every Halloween. It's like a haunted house, but each scene shows teenage church members acting out scenes of things the church considers sins. There's a homosexual dying of AIDS; a girl in an abortion clinic (on a doctor's table with fake blood splashed between her legs); a mom who leaves her family for someone she meets on the Internet. George Ratliff made a documentary about all this called Hell House . He plays some of his footage and talks about how effective it is, and how much of a thrill it is for the pious teenagers to act like sinners. (14 minutes)

Song:“The Devil Went Down to Georgia” by Charlie Daniels Band

Act Two
Faron Yoder lives in Amish country in Indiana. When he was a teenager, like every Amish sixteen-year-old, Faron was allowed to abandon the restrictions of Amish life and live as a regular American teenager. It's part of an Amish tradition called rumspringa, which lets Amish kids drive cars and drink and party for a few years, before they decide whether or not to be baptised into the Amish church and live an Amish life. Now 21, Faron explains to Ira why most Amish kids decide to stay Amish after rumspringa, and why, at 21, he hasn't. He's featured in a documentary called Devil's Playground, by filmmaker Lucy Walker.

      <description>Stories about what happens when a new guy comes on the scene and changes everything.

Host Ira Glass talks with Sarah Koenig, about the first and only time a movie star came over to her family's house when she was a kid, and how it didn't go too well, for the celebrity or for her. The movie star, Robert Redford, ended up stealing all her parents' attention, attention they usually lavished on Sarah, the youngest. On top of that, they were acting all nervous, and anxious, different than usual. It made young Sarah mad, and she ended up taking it out on poor Mr. Redford. (6 minutes)
By Ira Glass Sarah Koenig

Act One
The story of what happens to an average American family, when a perfectly normal, rational and funny mom starts spending every day in the company of an ancient Buddhist monk named Aaron, who no one else can see. Davy Rothbart is one of her three sons, and also the reporter for this story. He goes back and to talk to his brothers and father and mother about something they've never actually discussed: Do any of them believe in Aaron? Davy is the man behind Found Magazine. (26 minutes)
By Davy Rothbart

Act Two
Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr. already had one other man in his life who shared his name—his world famous father, the Jesse Jackson. But then right before his most recent primary race, an aide told him that he now had another Jesse Jackson to contend with. This other Jesse Jackson, a retired truck driver with no political experience, had mysteriously appeared on the same voting ballot as congressman Jackson. Ira reports on whether this was all a strange coincidence or a bit of political mischief orchestrated by the Congressman's political rivals. (9 minutes)

      <description>When you turn someone over to the authorities, it can set into motion lots of huge, unintended consequences.

Host Ira Glass explains that when you name names, when you whistleblow, when you tell on someone, you often do it anonymously. We hear from one anonymous squealer, who was done wrong by her doctor—he messed up a procedure and then refused to fix it. She decided to get even with him by turning him in to the IRS. (6 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Reporter Jon Ronson tells the story of how, in the immediate wake of September 11, he became convinced that a man he'd done a story on was responsible for the Anthrax attacks in America. So he did something he'd never done before, he ratted out his source to the FBI. He then felt the guilt of accusing someone who turns out not to be guilty. Jon Ronson is the author of the book, Them: Adventures with Extremists . (18 minutes)

Song:“Dust in the Wind” by Kansas

Act Two
We hear excerpts from two autobiographies which each describe the same moment, but in very different ways. Elia Kazan and Arthur Miller agree that they met with each other in 1952, around the time Kazan named the names of his old friends to the House Committee on Un-American Activities. But they don't agree on what the conversation was like. Kazan describes it in his memoir, A Life , as cordial, supportive. Miller describes it in his Timebends as quietly calamitous. And after this moment, each man went on to defend his position in later work—Miller with The Crucible , about the dangers of bandwagon accusation; and Kazan with On The Waterfront , containing perhaps the single greatest testimony to squealing in the history of film.

      <description>DNA evidence isn't just proving wrongdoing by criminals, it's proving wrongdoing by police and prosecutors.

Host Ira Glass surveys the effects DNA has had on the criminal justice landscape. He talks with Huy Dao, at the Innocence Project , where they are waist-deep in 2,000 letters from prisoners claiming DNA can prove them innocent. Charlotte Word at Cellmark Diagnostics, the largest and oldest private DNA forensics lab in the country, explains how their caseload is expanding into all sorts of new areas like insurance claims and medical malpractice suits. John Stanton, a detective in Arlington, Texas, recently opened up over 49 old unsolved cases, to see if DNA might be successful where old methods weren't. One case he reopened: The very first case he went on himself as a young crime scene officer in 1985. And finally, Chicago Tribune investigative reporter Maurice Possley explains that DNA has shed so much doubt on the criminal justice system in Illinois that now prosecutors and judges are reopening questionable cases that don't even have DNA evidence. (6 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
This is the story of some teenagers who were wrongfully convicted of murder and served 15 years in prison. DNA set them free, then convicted the two men who really did the crime. Shane DuBow reports on how the police framed them with the crime in the first place, and what it's like to be in prison when you know you're innocent. (37 minutes)

Host Ira Glass plays tape from the documentary TV series American High of a teenager fighting with his parents about which car he can take out that night. Every family has its own way of fighting and its own particular family dynamic, and if things go terribly bad, it's often hard to figure how the bad things could've been prevented. (1 minute)

      <description>There's the thing you plan to do, and then there's the thing you end up doing.

Ira summarizes the results of an informal poll of about a hundred people, about whether they were living their Plan A or Plan B and recounts a moment from a short story by author Ron Carlson. (2 minutes) Ron Carlson's story is called &quot;Plan B for the Middle Class,&quot; it's from his book by the same name.
By Ira Glass

Act One
John Hodgman first encountered Cuervo Man on a press junket to Cuervo Nation, a small island owned by Jose Cuervo Tequila. Cuervo Man was wearing nothing but a Speedo, wraparound shades, and a red cape. Occasionally he’d stick a toilet plunger on his bald head. John was fascinated and eventually got to know Cuervo Man, whose real name was Ryan. Though the Cuervo act was Ryan’s Plan B, it had a special power that John couldn't help but envy. (19 minutes) John Hodgman is the host of the Judge John Hodgman podcast.
By John Hodgman

By Ira Glass
Song:“All of Me” by Frank Sinatra (radio only)

      <description>How the American Psychiatric Association decided that homosexuality was no longer a mental illness.

Host Ira Glass explains that the show this week consists of one long story, the story of something very small that was part of something very large in the history of our country. (2 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
In 1973, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) declared that homosexuality was not a disease simply by changing the 81-word definition of sexual deviance in its own reference manual. It was a change that attracted a lot of attention at the time, but the story of what led up to that change is one that we hear today, from reporter Alix Spiegel. Part one of Alix's story details the activities of a closeted group of gay psychiatrists within the APA who met in secret and called themselves the GAYPA...and another, even more secret group of gay psychiatrists among the political echelons of the APA. Alix's own grandfather was among these psychiatrists, and the president-elect of the APA at the time of the change. (24 minutes) Alix is the co-host of NPR’s Invisibilia .

      <description>Personal recordings one person made for just one other person.

We hear a tape that a man named David Cossin made for a woman in Italy named Allesandra whom he'd met during a week he spent there, and with whom he'd fallen in love. He sent her a dozen tapes, including one where he tries to convince her to move to New York and be with him. Ira explains that hearing this tape - made by one person for one other - is different than other things you hear on the radio. Most radio stories are for an audience of many. This week, an audience of many listens in on tapes intended for an audience of one. (3 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Jonathan Goldstein with a story about friendship, mothers and sons, and what some have called the greatest phone message in the world. Jonathan is the host of the podcast Heavyweight . (19 minutes)
By Jonathan Goldstein

Act Two
Kevin Murphy is a college student in Idaho who stutters. Using the power of radio editing, he and the production staff of This American Life removed his pauses, stutters and repeats so that he could record a message the way it seems the rest of the world would like to hear him sound. His recording is for one person...a pizza guy, in Idaho. (6 minutes)
By Kevin Murphy

Act Three
During the first Gulf War, John Brasfield was an army scout. He went on dangerous missions, in which he was exposed often to enemy fire with little protection. On most missions, he took along a cassette recorder and taped the action for his wife.  He did it so that if something did happen to him, she'd at least know the circumstances. At one point he recorded, by accident, what may have been the unnecessary killling of Iraqi soldiers who'd already surrendered. (18 minutes)

      <description>Stories of faith: losing it, talking about it, constructing it, and working within it.

A story of faith lost, thanks to a book about extraterrestrials and a Rabbi. (6 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
An explanation of what Christians and Muslims talk about in a place you might not expect them to get along at all: Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. Host Ira Glass talks with Georg Taubmann, a relief worker with the Christian missionary group Shelter Now, who built houses and did other good works in Afghanistan for seventeen years, until he was arrested by the Taliban in August. He was rescued in November. He says that it's actually easier to talk religion with the Afghans than it is in the U.S. or in Taubmann's home country of Germany. (7 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act Two
Josh Noel reports with Alex Blumberg from Groom, Texas, 45 minutes east of Amarillo, on the largest cross in the Western hemisphere—it's 19 stories tall—the man who built it, and the people who stop at the cross to pray. (18 minutes)

Ira talks with students from rival high schools, Glenbrook North and Glenbrook South. (3 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Several years ago, before most of us paid much attention to the name Osama bin Laden, Reporter Jon Ronson spent a year following around a Muslim activist named Omar Bakri, who called himself bin Laden's &quot;man in London.&quot; At first Ronson thought Bakri was on the &quot;them&quot; side of &quot;us and them.&quot; But then Ronson got to know him, and changed his mind. After September 11th, he had to change his mind again. Ronson tells his story, which includes excerpts from his book Them: Adventures with Extremists . (20 minutes)

      <description>Of all the wars to win, perhaps the propaganda war is the hardest.

We hear clips from the recent press conference with Charlotte Beers, recently appointed Undersecretary of Public Diplomacy. Part of her job is, in her words, to sell the &quot;brand America&quot; abroad. To consider all the difficulties she might face in certain parts of the world, host Ira Glass talks with Zdenka Milanovich, who ran the marketing campaign for Ariel laundry detergent, the European equivalent of Tide, in Pakistan. He also talks with John Quelch, a marketing expert from Harvard. (9 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
The story of a clandestine radio station the CIA set up back in the good old, bad old days of the 1950s, to overthrow Guatemala. The coup succeeded because of the immense power of radio. Or that's what the CIA believed, anyway. We play the recently declassified tapes of the station's broadcasts. We believe it's the first time they've ever been broadcast in this country. Nancy Updike reports. (25 minutes)

      <description>A young boy, an abandoned house, and the mysterious family who disappeared without a trace.

Ira introduces this week's story. (1 minute)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Adam Beckman tells the first part of his story, about how, back in the 70s, he and his friends broke into an abandoned  house in the small town of  Freedom, New Hampshire. The home turned out to be a perfect time capsule, containing the furniture, letters and personal effects of an entire family — abandoned for decades. It seemed like the family just vanished one day, leaving salt and pepper shakers on the table, notes on the bedroom mirror, and a wallet with money still inside. Adam and his friends read the letters, saving some as clues, and never forgot. (30 minutes.)

Prologue
Ira Glass talks with Paul Feig, who, as a sixth-grader, read the Dale Carnegie classic How to Win Friends and Influence People at the urging of his father. He found that afterward, he had a bleaker understanding of human nature—and even fewer friends than when he started. (9 minutes)

Act One
David Sedaris has this instructive tale of how, as a boy, with the help of his dad, he tried to bridge the chasm that divides the popular kid from the unpopular — with the sorts of results that perhaps you might anticipate. (14 minutes)
By David Sedaris

Act Two
After the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, U.S. diplomats had to start working the phones to assemble a coalition of nations to combat this new threat. Some of the calls, you get the feeling, were not the easiest to make. Writer and performer Tami Sagher imagines what those calls were like. (6 minutes)

Song:“This Is The World Calling” by Bob Geldof

Act Three

Rod Hudson grew up on a dairy farm in New Hampshire. When his father retired, Rod ran his own operation on his dad's property and did just fine until the mid 1980's when something strange started to happen with the cows. A series of strange things started to happen actually, beginning with their hooves. (6 minutes)

Act One
In 1946, a man named David Boder started to investigate the Holocaust before it was known as the Holocaust. He dragged a primitive recording device around Europe and gathered the first recorded testimonials of concentration camp survivors. But his research was largely ignored, and his recordings forgotten for decades. The tapes are broadcast for the first time nationally on tonight's show. Carl Marziali tells the story. (31 minutes). Listen to Boder's recordings, or read transcripts, at their official home on the web.

      <description>We try to sort out what the war in Afghanistan will be like.

Host Ira Glass explains that if we're going to war—as the President keeps promising—it's hard to understand what's in store for us. Today's show is an attempt to figure that out. (1 minute)
By Ira Glass

Act One
For a few days after the attacks on September 11th, it seemed like we were just on the verge of bombing and retaliation. But two weeks went by, and no military action had begun. To help sort out exactly what we knew at this point about what the war would be like, Ira talks with NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Gjelten. (5 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act Two
One way to understand what war will be like is to understand what past wars were like. Andrew Carroll recently started something called the Legacy Project, which collects letters Americans wrote home during wartime, from the Civil War up through the conflicts in the Persian Gulf and Bosnia. It's over 50,000 letters, a portion of which he assembled into a book titled War Letters. We also hear from Estelle Lynch, who received over 500 letters from her fiance Sid Diamond during World War II. (14 minutes)

Song:“Remember Pearl Harbor” by Sammy Kaye and his Orchestra with the Glee Club

Act Three
An excerpt from a story that writer Lee Sandlin wrote for the Chicago Reader about what it is that makes wartime different and about the particular psychology of being at war. It was a massive historical article, exhaustively researched. Sandlin was interested in World War II—in why it'd been forgotten—and in what exactly had been forgotten. Actor Matt Malloy reads. Sandlin's article appeared in the Chicago Reader in March 1997, in two parts. Contact them for more information on getting a copy. (13 minutes)

Ira talks with two New Yorkers on their reactions to seeing something they could never have believed possible. They acted in ways that they never had before, just ran around and around in circles. (4 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One

Song:“Then Was Then, Now Is Now” by Peggy Lee

Act Two
David Rakoff tells the story of the day that used to hold the record as the worst disaster in New York history: June 15th, 1904, when the steamship The General Slocum, caught fire and sank in the Hudson river, killing 1,031 passengers. Almost everyone aboard was from one neighborhood in New York, and by all accounts, that neighborhood was never the same again. (9 minutes)
By David Rakoff

Act Three
In our search for events that might illuminate what we've seen in New York this week, we hear interviews with survivors of a terrorist attack that happened in a crowded city, during rush hour, just six years ago. On March 20, 1995, the Aum cult dropped plastic bags of poison gas on the Tokyo subway. Haruki Murakami interviewed dozens of survivors about what happened, and how they got on with their lives afterwards. The English edition of the book of interviews is called Underground: the Tokyo Gas Attack and the Japanese Psyche , and he gave us permission to read portions of it here. (12 minutes)

Reporter Mark Arax spent three years investigating the murder of his father and yet he's still not at peace when he thinks of his dad's death. (His book is called In My Father's Name .) This is how it goes sometimes: We create a story that tries to explain our lives, and it still leaves so much unanswered. (6 minutes)
By Ira Glass

      <description>The story of one man's journey from obscurity to international professional celebrity.

Host Ira Glass talks with Stephen Goldin, author of an online guide that prescribes 23 rules for comic fans to follow when mingling with professional sci-fi authors at sci-fi conventions. For instance: don't try to start a discussion with a pro on the way to the bathroom. And this week, Ira explains, breaks eight of the 23 rules. (3 minutes)
By Ira Glass

The story of two amateurs meeting the pros. One is a teenager in New Jersey; the other, our reporter.

By Joel Lovell

Act Two
Ira travels to Las Vegas for the World Series of Poker , gets hooked, and tries to figure out what it would mean if he'd ditch his job in radio to become a professional card player. What he learns: A professional gambler can suffer two heartbreaking losses back-to-back, costing him over $100,000, and moments later, at the casino bar, calculate the million-to-one odds of his unlikely losses...in his head.

      <description>A modern-day fable about what happens when the free market, the media, the World War II buffs, the Neo-Nazis, and the Jews all collide over a huge Nazi tourist trap.

Host Ira Glass joins a group of tourists to walk through the captured German submarine that's on permanent display at Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry. He notes that the Museum chooses to underplay the murderous Nazi origins of the boat. He then makes some broad generalizations that lead, inevitably, to the introduction to our story on Hitler's Yacht. (3 minutes)

By Howie Chackowicz

      <description>Stories of dads who are utterly human in scale.

Leah remembers when her parents got divorced and her dad, a farmer in North Dakota, moved to an apartment in town. It was cramped and ugly, and it had a Murphy bed that made a horrible creak when you brought it down from the wall. It was the first time she'd seen him look vulnerable, and not at all the heroic can-do guy he once was to her. At some point, of course, every dad comes down off the pedestal; it's just that some do it more gracefully than others. This, she says, was too early, too sudden. (6 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
A collection of small stories, all on the the theme introduced in the prologue—the first few months after the divorce, and suddenly, your parents are less composed, more flawed, and more human, than perhaps you've ever seen them. (13 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act Two
Ian Brown explains the lengths a normal dad will go to give his daughter a memorable birthday party, including a birthday stunt so crass that he and his wife shocked all their friends. Ian Brown is the author of Man, Medium Rare and Freewheeling , and the host of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's program Talking Books. (13 minutes)

Act One
One way to measure the faith—the good old-fashioned faith—that people put in celebrities is to examine what people ask of them.

      <description>Women planning to get pregnant with the help of a sperm bank tell us about the questions they wrestle with of how much they want to know about the fathers of their kids.

Host Ira Glass talks with Cate, a white woman with a black, adopted, seven-year-old son, Glen. Sometimes Glen threatens that he's going to return to his real family—royalty, in Africa. The only thing is, Glen's not adopted from Africa. He's adopted from Chicago. But this is the way it goes: Even if there are real parents out there somewhere, sometimes it's more comforting for a kid to believe in a fantasy. (3 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Most sperm banks provide all sorts of information about their donors: Education level, medical background. They even have videotaped interviews and recorded answers to essay questions. But not all clients take advantage of this information. In fact, lots of women choose to avoid it. Reporter Alix Spiegel talks with single women who are planning to get pregnant with the help of a sperm bank and finds that they all wrestle with the question of how much they want to know about the fathers of their kids—and how much they want their kids to know. (20 minutes) Alix's story was produced in part with a grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Recorded at Chicago's Audi Home Juvenile Detention Facility, the song was part of a show put on by Chicago's Music Theatre Workshop.
By Alix Spiegel

Act Two
We hear a series of letters that originally appeared on the brief-lived, little-known, but well-loved webzine Open Letters . They're written by a woman who signs her name as &quot;X&quot; and are addressed to the father of her adolescent son. X has no idea where to send the letters, but she keeps writing. Since the letters' original publication on the Internet, X has decided to reveal her identity. Her name is Miriam Toews, and she's author of the book Swing Low, A Life . Her letters were read for us by Alexa Junge. (17 minutes)

Act Three
When Starlee Kine was a kid, she wanted to be a child star so badly that she signed up for an acting class with a famous acting teacher named Kevin McDermott. One of the class's exercises was to develop a character with a troubled past, and a real psychologist would come in for a session of character group therapy. Starlee chose to take on the character of an orphan. In fact, Starlee remembers that everyone else in her class did too. Twenty years later, she visits her old acting teacher in Los Angeles and discovers that for some reason, kids today don't want to be orphans. (9 minutes)

By Scott Carrier Ira Glass

Act One
At a fairly bleak time in his life, Scott took a job driving all over the state of Utah, interviewing people who were diagnosed with schizophrenia.

Song:“I Travel Alone” by Noel Coward

Act Two
It's another not-so-great period in Scott's life. This time he takes a job inside his profession, as a producer for a national commercial radio program. His boss is a nationally recognized host who Scott refers to only as &quot;The Friendly Man.&quot; Again, things don't go so well. (16 minutes)

      <description>The story of what was, at one time, one of most notoriously racist and corrupt suburbs in America.

We hear from Father Jim Kastigar, who got on the wrong side of Town Hall and suffered the kinds of consequences people in Cicero suffer. His parish was denied a permit to hold an outdoor religious ceremony they'd held peacefully for seven years, the youth group's tamale fundraiser was shut down by city inspectors and the parking lot near the church was deemed unfit for Sunday parking. (7 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
To understand how Cicero reacted when Hispanics started flooding into town, you have to understand how it dealt with conflict in the past. For a period the town was run by Al Capone, and the mob was connected to Town Hall for most of the twentieth century. Since the 1950s, the town also had the reputation of being &quot;the Selma of the North,&quot; with black people being driven from town by angry mobs while the authorities turned the other cheek; and a police chief who wore a t-shirt that says, &quot;Police Brutality: The Fun Part of Police Work.&quot; (7 minutes)
By Ira Glass Alex Kotlowitz

Act Two
In the 1970s and 1980s, a wave of non-white migration into Cicero begins, this one primarily Mexican-American. The head of the political machine is named Betty Loren-Maltese, whose husband, now deceased, was convicted for mob-related activity. She responds to the newcomers with some of the intimidation tactics of the past, but also with some new ones that no town anywhere seems to have tried. (13 minutes)
By Ira Glass Alex Kotlowitz

Act Three
Despite the town's resistance, Hispanics now make up three quarters of the population. And yet the incumbent Town President, Betty Loren-Maltese, seems likely to win the next election. We learn how she's maintaining her hold on power. (10 minutes)

      <description>Which is better: flight or invisibility?

Host Ira Glass talks to comic artist Chris Ware, who thought about superheroes a lot of the time as a kid. In grade school, Chris drew superheroes, he invented his own character named The Hurricane (not to be confused with Reuben Carter), and he made a superhero costume. Sometimes he wore parts of the costume to school under his regular clothes, which went fine until he realized he would have to change clothes for gym class. Click below to see the comic Chris made about this story. His book, Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth , is also inhabited by a &quot;superhero&quot; of sorts. (6 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
John Hodgman conducts an informal survey in which he asks the age-old question: Which is better: The power of flight or the power of invisibility? He finds that how you answer tells a lot about what kind of person you are. And also, no matter which power people choose, they never use it to fight crime. (14 minutes)
By John Hodgman
Song:“That Man” by Peggy Lee

Act Two
Kelly McEvers with the story of Zora, a self-made superhero. From the time she was five, Zora had recurring dreams in which she was a 6'5&quot; warrior queen who could fly and shoot lightning from her hands. She made a list of all the skills she would need to master if she wanted to actually become the superhero she dreamed of being. Sample items: Martial arts, evasive driving and bomb diffusion. She actually checked off most things on the list...and then had a run-in with the CIA. (17 minutes)
By Kelly McEvers

Act Three
Ira talks with Jonathan Morris, the amazingly funny and charming editor of the website Gone and Forgotten , an Internet archive of failed comic book characters. Jonathan explains what makes a new superhero succeed, and what makes him tank. (9 minutes)

      <description>Stories of people living completely outside the grid of American life.

Ira talks with Lee Qi, who came to America from China. He worked in Chinese restaurants in small towns, live in tiny apartments with other illegal immigrants who worked there as well—apartments that were sometimes in the back of the restaurants. He couldn't speak English, didn't go to school. He was 15. It was like being in limbo, he says: Here in America, but not part of it at all. (4 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
The Jarvis family, a group of eight, goes on the run from the law—for seven years. They live on a boat, in a treehouse in a swamp. They escape capture time after time. And how do the kids turn out, living a life outside of society, as fugitives? Surprisingly great. (23 minutes)
By Alex Blumberg

Act Two
Adam Gopnik reads a story from his book Paris to the Moon , about living in Paris with his family and wanting his son to be a bit more American. He tells him a bedtime story about the most American thing he can think of: baseball. But it doesn't work out the way he planned. (18 minutes)

      <description>Democrats explain why they're having trouble getting over the 2001 election, and Republicans explain why this is so infuriating.

We got a new President, but after the recount mess in Florida in the fall of 2001 and the Supreme Court decision that ended the election, some people were having a hard time moving on. Why? Why couldn't they just let it go? Host Ira Glass talks with people at the inauguration. Republican Chris Robling talks with a Democratic friend. (5 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Jonathan Chait of The New Republic and David Horowitz of Slate magazine each tell the story of the Florida recount. There is astonishingly little overlap in their accounts. It's not just that they interpret the facts differently; they don't agree on the facts either. (8 minutes)

Act Three
When it comes to political fighting, there's no more intimate a space than a marriage, where you have to get along. Where you have to figure out how to move on and get over disagreement. Living in Nashville, Tennessee, Scott and Carrie Rayson agreed about politics until this year—when it became the one subject in their marriage that they cannot discuss. (11 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act Four
We return to the Supreme Court case of Bush vs. Gore to try to better understand why the majority ruled the way it did...and whether the decision was in fact as outrageous as many critics said it was. Four legal scholars explain: Jeffry Rosen, Mike McConnell, Pam Karlan and Greg Sisk. (14 minutes)

      <description>A brother and sister decide to invent children to babysit, as an excuse to get out of their own house.

We listen in on a ritual that happens in millions of families every week: kids getting dropped off at the babysitters. Six-year-old Dylan and nine-year-old Sarah explain what they can and can't get away with when they have a babysitter. After that, host Ira Glass has a few words about Mary Poppins, who is the Gold Standard of all fictional babysitters. The movie Mary Poppins contains the classic modern song about babysitting. We hear several versions of the song over the course of the program. The first is by Chicago girl punk/pop band, the Dishes.  (5 minutes) Download song: &quot;The Perfect Nanny, from Mary Poppins&quot;, The Dishes

Act One
Lots of babysitting is done by family members. Hillary Frank reports on what can happen when a teenaged son is put in charge of his younger brothers. It's not pretty. (14 minutes) Hillary is the writer of the fictional podcast, “ Here Lies Me .” The Mary Poppins song in this act is performed by Jon Langford, with John Rice on mandolin. Download : &quot;The Perfect Nanny, from Mary Poppins&quot;, Jon Langford
By Hillary Frank

Act Two
The story of several huge companies that accidentally got put into the babysitting business in a big, big way because of snow on December 26, 1988. Every year on the day after Christmas, divorced kids all over America fly from one parent to the other. In 1988, lots of them got snowed in at O'Hare Airport in Chicago. Susan Burton and her little sister were among them. (9 minutes) This story was turned into the 2006 movie Unaccompanied Minors .

      <description>A live show taped for our fifth anniversary.

We hear the story of a disastrous birthday party and how it's hard not to see these kinds of moments as symbolic of something bad. (5 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Sarah Vowell takes over the family Thanksgiving dinner by bringing everyone to New York. What results is a series of milestones and family firsts. Everyone in the family is the kind of person who prefers to be alone, so the very thing that binds them together as a family actually makes it hard for them to spend time together. (14 minutes)

Song:“Bye Bye Baby” by OK Go

Act Two
The story of Tyler Cassity and how he's trying to remake one of our oldest rituals of commemoration. Tyler is one of the owners of a cemetery called Hollywood Forever, and he's been introducing 20th century technology to American funerals, which haven't changed much since the Civil War. At Hollywood Forever, the cost of a burial includes a video of your life: to be shown at your funeral, to be viewable at kiosks on the cemetery grounds, and to be posted—for eternity—online.

      <description>A story of self-deception, a story about deceiving others, and a story about accidental deception.

Host Ira Glass reads an excerpt from Nick Hornby's novel About a Boy . The narrator, Will, recalls a time when he was a child that he convinced a friend that a portal to another world existed at the back of his closet. Will knew that the portal didn't exist, but continued the lie for some reason, even as he and his friend crawled through the winter coats by the closet baseboards looking for a hidden gateway. He just kept hoping that maybe they'd find something. (4 minutes)
By Ira Glass Nick Hornby

Act One
Producer Alex Blumberg tells the story of an ex-con-turned-actor named Richie Castellano. After a bit role in the movie Analyze This , he moved to a small town and got dozens of people to invest money and time in a movie that never premiered. Why so many people bought into his grandiose dreams, and what they learned about him—and themselves—after they got burned for it. (22 minutes)
By Alex Blumberg
Song:“Ex-Con” by Smog

Act Two
Lawrence Otis Graham reads from an account of how he left his job as a $105,000-a-year Manhattan attorney to enter the exclusive Greenwich Country Club the only way they'd allow a black man like him: as a busboy. He discovers just how invisible he can become once he gives up his seat at the table and starts clearing the dishes instead—so invisible that people make racist remarks right in front of him. The passage is from his book A Member of the Club: Reflections on Life in a Racially Polarized World . (16 minutes)

Act One
In this act, we hear several stories that happened during the daylight hours of the diner's operation. The first is from Nancy Updike, who talks with early morning customers, including one guy who comes in mornings to play his accordion, and another who at the age of 8 was the youngest butcher in Illinois. We also hear from several regulars who come to the Golden Apple every day, more than once. Many of them are old and alone. They say they come for the coffee, and to talk to the waitresses. Reporter Susan Burton talks with two friends who used to be a couple. They stopped dating three years ago, but haven't stopped fighting about whose fault it was. An older lady who grew up in the neighborhood explains her neighbors' feelings towards African Americans and gay people. (29 minutes)

      <description>Stories for the eve of the 2000 presidential election, in which we try to look beneath the candidates' soundbites.

Host Ira Glass talks with Bennett Miller and Matt Futterman about a campaign for student government that changed the way student elections were done in Mamaroneck High School back in 1985. Futterman, in the waning days of his campaign, tried a radical tactic: A TV ad. It led to a wave of television ads for student office at the school, most of which misunderstood what made Futterman's ad so successful. (7 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
A Michigan millionaire tries to swing his swing state, using only his voice, his millions, and major market radio ad time. A report on Jeffrey Fieger, who helped swing his state to McCain during the primaries with several irreverant attack ads against Bush. In this age when we all wish our politicians would shoot from the hip, Fieger delivers, for good and bad. Contributing editor Jack Hitt goes with Fieger to the studio, as Fieger records a new set of anti-Bush spots for the general election. (13 minutes)
By Jack Hitt

Act Two
The 2000 election season was strange in that many of the issues that the candidates debated most heatedly were ones that most of us have no handle on—prescription drug policy, social security solvency...and educational accountability. Producer Alex Blumberg travels to North Carolina, a state where many of the promises both candidates make regarding education are already in place. He finds, not surprisingly, that they work better as soundbite than as policy, and that if the two candidates get their way with education, it'll push it in a direction most North Carolina teachers find alarming.

      <description>We look at a 1996 immigration law that is too obscure for most of us to have heard of, but which affects tens of thousands of lives in huge ways.

Host Ira Glass goes to jail in Bristol County, Massachussetts, where there's a large Portuguese community, and where even a law-and-order sheriff named Tom Hodgson opposes this particular immigration law. He also talks with inmate Jorge Aruda, who's being deported for a crime he already served his sentence for. (8 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Producer Blue Chevigny tells more of the story from Bristol County, where the immigration law of 1996 has a community of non-political people reluctantly going to protests, attending meetings at night, talking to politicians, and doing all sorts of other things most of us would do anything to avoid. (16 minutes)
By Blue Chevigny

Act Two
Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman Bill Strassberger explains why INS opposes parts of the 1996 immigration law, even while it enforces it. Congressman Barney Frank—whose district includes Bristol County—argues that most of his colleagues in Congress had no idea what they were voting for when they voted for key portions of the law. And an advocate for the law, John Martin from the Federation for American Immigration Reform, explains why we actually should want to deport more people. (12 minutes)

Host Ira Glass speaks with two people who believe they've uncovered behind-the-scenes conspiracies but can't be sure. Attorney Andy Hail has sued the two biggest supermarkets in Chicago (Dominick's and Jewel) because they charge a dollar more for milk than stores around the country, and because their prices seem to change simultaneously, as if orchestrated. Cindi Canary from the Illinois Campaign for Political Reform tells the story of an Illinois law that seems to mostly benefit one man—the man who made sure it made it though the legislature.

Act One

Host Ira Glass tells the story of a time capsule project designed to document our lives so that people a thousand years from now can know what we were like. Ira explains that when a friend of his got involved in the time capsule, Ira realized that he hates the people of the future. But lots of people don't. Lots of people worry about how they'll be remembered. This show is about that sad, sad lot. (4 minutes)

Act One
Sarah Vowell visits four Presidential libraries on a fact-finding tour for...President Clinton. Not that he asked her. But she wanted to offer a little advice about what should and should not be in the Presidential library he'll soon be building in Arkansas. Rejected titles for this act of our show: &quot;Can You Direct Me to the Dick Morris Exhibit?,&quot; &quot;The Last and Longest Press Conference,&quot; &quot;How a Bill Becomes an Archive,&quot; &quot;All the President's Pens,&quot; &quot;It's the Eternity, Stupid,&quot; and &quot;If This Library Be A Rockin, Don't Come a Knockin.&quot; (25 minutes)
By Sarah Vowell

Act Two
What if you're remembered in ways that you don't like? What if you're remembered for something someone else did? In this act, we consider the case of Marguerite Oswald, mother of Lee Harvey Oswald. In 1965 she spent three days with reporter Jean Stafford, who wrote about Mrs. Oswald for McCall's magazine and later in a book called A Mother in History . This American Life producer Susan Burton tracked down the tapes of the interview to the University of Colorado in Boulder. According to the librarians in the Special Collections there, this is the first time the tapes have been played publicly—possibly the first time the tapes have ever been heard by anyone but Jean Stafford and Mrs. Oswald herself. On the tapes, Marguerite Oswald defends her parenting skills against the conclusions of the Warren Commission Report . (13 minutes)

      <description>Does anyone's family ever change?

Host Ira Glass describes a children's book from the 1970s called Nobody's Family Is Going to Change by Louise Fitzhugh, the author of Harriet the Spy . On the surface, it sounds like a rather menacing title for a kids' book. But in fact, the story is about how kids can finally find peace if they stop hoping that their parents will ever be any different. The question is, though: Is it true? Does anyone's family ever change? (3 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Julia Pimsleur travels to Alaska to spend some time with her brother, hoping he might change a little—just as he hopes that she'll change a little. She made a documentary film about her trip, from which the sound in this story comes, called Brother Born Again . (30 minutes)
By Julia Pimsleur
Song:“In the Lines” by Portastatic

Act Two
What can happen if a sibling relationship doesn't ever change. Hillary Frank brings us the story of two sisters, now in their seventies, who have preserved the same relationship they had as girls...for better or worse. (9 minutes)

      <description>David Sedaris takes Ira on a tour of his favorite spots in Paris.

Host Ira Glass talks with writer David Sedaris at the Louvre in Paris. David's never set foot inside, though he lives just a few minutes away. He says most people go to the Louvre because they think they should. Where he would take them if they wanted to see the city where he's lived for two years is very different. (6 minutes).
By Ira Glass

Act One
David Sedaris takes Ira on a tour of his favorite spots in Paris. He moved to France with no special feelings for the place. His head wasn't full of Ernest Hemingway and Gertrude Stein and Sartre and Proust; he was a blank slate. And so the places he's found as his favorites tend to be places where the people aren't mean to him when he speaks French, or places where very unusual and fascinating objects are sold, or place that are unlike anywhere in the States. (27 minutes). David describes his struggle with daily life in France in his book Me Talk Pretty One Day .

Song:“Si Tu Dois Partir” by Lloyd Cole (radio)

Act Two

Monica Childs joined the Detroit police force because she hated cops, and wanted to change the system from the inside. She wanted to be an honest cop. Which she was able to do as she rose through the ranks—until one day in 1996, when it suddenly wasn't so easy any more. (5 minutes)

      <description>Stories of people who did not want to move but circumstance forced their hands.

Ben Schrank describes what it's like to work as a professional mover. He says that people often go sort of nuts when they see all their worldly possessions—all the stuff that defines them as people—packed into a van. It's a humbling experience for people, and just one of the reasons people hate to move. The other reasons: It's hard starting in a new place; it's dreadful leaving an old place; and the process of moving itself is a hardship. So today...we have stories of people who were forced to move—but who did not want to and tried to thwart it. (5 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
This is a story of people wanting to change and not wanting to change at all. A Minnesota family builds the same 1970s-era suburban house three times, and moves it once, just so they don't have to live in a house that's different than the house that contains all their memories. Susan Burton reports. (22 minutes)

Host Ira Glass explains the premise of the show, and we hear what's actually going on inside five of these cars. (7 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Linnel Peterson drives the Number 66 bus in Chicago, on Chicago Avenue. She grew up just blocks from the route, still lives near the route, and says it's strange whenever she drives her car on Chicago Avenue these days. She sees people waiting for the bus and momentarily heads over to pick them up. (5 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act Two
Nick Hornby, author of High Fidelity and About a Boy , explains the travails of driving his autistic son to the park. (6 minutes)
By Nick Hornby

Act Three
Jay Allison and his 12-year-old daughter discuss what radio station to listen to. She wants music. He wants...public radio. She sighs in exasperation.

By Jay Allison
Song:“Satisfaction” by Cat Power

      <description>David Foster Wallace reports on a turning point in the 2000 presidential primary.

Host Ira Glass talks with Jack E. Robinson, Republican candidate for Senate in Massachusetts. Within 24 hours of announcing that he was going to collect signatures to get on the ballot to run against Teddy Kennedy, Robinson was attacked in the press. And so he tried a novel tactic: He issued a long public statement that is simply one of the most remarkable documents of current political life in this country. He called it The Robinson Report and posted it on the Internet for anyone to read. It outlines, in matter-of-fact prose and a disturbing level of detail, everything he thinks he's ever done wrong. It's not clear if this helped him, or if it simply seemed so strange that people didn't know what to make of it. (5 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Dirty political attacks go back to the very beginning of the American Republic. What's different today, says historian Richard Norton Smith, is that television and the other electronic media have made our contact with the candidates so intimate. It has greater emotional impact on us because we see every wince cross a candidate's face. What could be more intimate than Jack E. Robinson's car crash, recorded on tape? (5 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act Two
David Foster Wallace reports on a turning point in past Presidential primaries: The moment when John McCain failed to respond well to an attack by George Bush...which arguably ended up costing him the election. (19 minutes)
By David Foster Wallace

Act Three
Former political consultant Ron Susskind says that when he began in politics, he thought there was nothing lower than negative campaigning. But then in 1980 he learned that sometimes when your opponent attacks you, it can actually help you. (3 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act Four
There is an entire class of consultant who does nothing but help people and companies that are under public attack. Eric Dezenhall is one of them. He works for a crisis management firm in Washington DC, and has written a book about his craft, called Nail 'Em. (9 minutes)

In the story, a mother reviews all that's gone wrong in the raising of her oldest daughter...and makes a few conclusions about what she should think about her mistakes as a mother. And Host Ira Glass interviews his own mother, who insists—several times—that mothers are always taken for granted. (7 minutes)

      <description>The pleasure and the terror of being in a rampaging, angry mob.

There's a TV ad so popular in Canada right now that people chant it in bars, stand and cheer it in theaters and at hockey stadiums. The ad taps into our desire to be part of a mob...and provides a safe way to do it, without fear. Host Ira Glass talks with the vice president for marketing for Molson's beer, which made the ad. (4 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Writer Bill Buford reads from his book Among the Thugs. In it he sets out to try and understand the soccer hooligans who were rioting in ways large and small on a regular basis after soccer matches. It's a remarkable book—in turns funny, and then horrifying. By the time Buford's done, you understand that the thrill of being in a violent mob is as hardwired into us, as basic to us as a species, as the ability to love. (18 minutes)
By Bill Buford
Song:“Main Title (The Godfather Waltz)” by Nino Rota

Act Two
What happens when seventh graders become an angry mob? Karen Bernstein reports on her own seventh grade class from small-town Connecticut. In 1973, a teacher turned them into an angry mob, an event they all remember decades later. She tracks down her classmates...and the teacher. (20 minutes)

Host Ira Glass stands at the corner of Diversey and Broadway in Chicago and describes all the people who are out at 3:00 on a weekday. (4 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
All those people you see in the middle of the workday, in coffee shops and bookstores? Who are they? Why aren't they at work? Reporter George Gurley tackled these tough questions. On four separate days, he interviewed these loafers in New York. (11 minutes)
By George Gurley

Act Two
At one grain elevator on the outskirts of Lincoln, Nebraska, during the slow months, the five burly men who load corn, soybeans, wheat and milo onto trains spend their work hours watching soap operas. Meghan Daum gets them to explain what they like about the Young and the Restless. (11 minutes)
Song:“Nice Work if You Can Get It” by Billie Holiday

Act Three
In the early 1970s, a geographer named Roger Hart did a study of exactly where it is that children go during the daytime. For two years, he followed 86 children—all the children in a small town in Vermont, during the hours when parents were away at work. In this rural setting, nearly every child had a secret hiding place somewhere. He explains what the places were, and why nearly every child in town had the compulsion to make a secret place. He published his findings in a book called Children's Experience of Place, which is now out of print. (5 minutes)

Act Four
A postman explains how it is that he can be so much a part of the scenery that people commit crimes in front of him, on quiet daytime streets, as if he's not there. This American Life producer Alex Blumberg spent a day with postman on Chicago's west side, to find out what he sees...and who sees him...and who doesn't see him, even though he's right there. (10 minutes)

Host Ira Glass talks with people who've been hit by lightning. They describe what happened at the moment the bolt struck ... and how they came to view it later. (5 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
David Rakoff goes in search of the only existing mementos of a year-and-a-half of his life when he nearly died from Hodgkins Disease. The missing relics are his own pre-chemotherapized sperm — which reside somewhere in a Toronto lab. But over the years, his hospital has moved, the lab has moved, and he has moved. (22 minutes)
By David Rakoff

Act Two
Keith Gessen, a young Russian emigre, revisits the heroes of his youth: the brave Soviet dissidents who risked their lives at the height of the Cold War. Many of them resettled into comfortable suburban lives in America. That these idealists would wind up on shady streets where private lives are more important than public ones is perplexing to Keith.

And—in the interest of equal time—a cashier who works at a chain store that sells pet products rants about the absurdity of the items she's ringing up every day: St. John's Wort for dogs, CDs for pets, spinach-flavored bones. (12 minutes)

      <description>The story of the book The Lonely Doll and its author, and how the author's life came to resemble something from her book.

Host Ira Glass talks about the human urge to turn something inanimate into something that's alive, about the moment Pinocchio stops being a concoction of wood and string and becomes a real boy. He chats with Ronn Lucas , a ventriloquist, about moments when his dummies have seemed alive enough to surprise him. (5 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
The story of a company trying an experiment at marketing dolls to little girls:A new kind of doll store near Chicago's Magnificent Mile called &quot;American Girl Place.&quot; The company has figured out all the ways little girls love dolls and they're trying to sell to nearly every one of those desires. Susan Burton reports that it's as if they've settled into a perch inside little girl's dreams and are selling from there. (14 minutes)

Song:“American Girl” by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers

Act Two

      <description>Stories from the New Hampshire primary. We hear from voters who've found candidates they love. And we hear what those voters are seeing that the rest of us aren't.

Three days into the beginning of the new millenium, Kahari Mosley and Garcia Suzinko left home to do something they'd never done before: They took a twelve-hour bus ride to New Hampshire to volunteer for a Presidential campaign. What they saw...and what moved them to volunteer in the first place. (6 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Here in America, here's how we interact with our political candidates: We dispatch middlemen to the scene, they listen to what the candidates say, they research the candidates' backgrounds, and they tell us what they think is most important. Those middlemen, of course, are journalists. Sarah Vowell tells a fable about the difference between the way the middlemen see the world and the way non-journalists see it. (23 minutes)
By Sarah Vowell

Act Two
Usually it's difficult to get to know the front-runner in a Presidential race. With the most to lose, front-runners are the least spontaneous candidates. They stay on message. In debates, George W. Bush often gives the same few answers to all sorts of different questions. Sarah Koenig has been covering the Bush campaign for months for the Concord Monitor , a New Hampshire newspaper. She tells a story of trying to get to know the &quot;real&quot; George W. Bush. (14 minutes)

      <description>Stories of kids trying to act like adults—some by choice—some because they're forced to.

The story of a teenagers' party among teenagers who thought of themselves as very grownup. In many ways they completely understand what a grownup party is like: Quiet conversation with lots of thoughtful nodding of heads, alcohol without excessive or loud consumption. Except there's one custom of an adult party they get completely wrong. (3 minutes)

Song:“Almost Grown” by Chuck Berry

Act Two
When Anh Tuan Hoang was 12 and living in Vietnam back in 1980, his cousin was scheming up a way to escape the country by boat. Anh Tuan was invited too. He wanted to go, but for reasons that had very little to do with reality and everything to do with the way a kid sees the world. (12 minutes)

Host Ira Glass talks with Robert Lipsyte, author of In the Country of Illness , who tells a story of how one lady in New York won the hospital staff over to her side with one conversation. (4 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
When Terry Shine's father was in the hospital, Terry and his brothers spent weeks trying to do whatever they could to help. But first they had to learn the language and customs of the average American hospital. For example, consider this question: Would their dad get better medical care if they dressed in cleanly pressed shirts and ties? This is an excerpt from Terry Shine's book Fathers Aren't Supposed to Die: Five Brothers Reunite to Say Goodbye . (15 minutes)

Song:“Tommy Gets His Tonsils Out” by The Replacements

Act Two
No radio program about caregivers in a hospital would be complete without a few words about the caregiver that is the most omnipresent...in every room, in the waiting rooms, at the nurses' stations. It's television. To investigate its power in a medical facility, Nancy Updike went to the most television-friendly hospital imaginable: The one actual television stars go to when they get sick, Cedar Sinai in Los Angeles. (6 minutes)
By Nancy Updike

Act Three
When a nurse asks a 14-year-old burn victim out for ice cream, is it a date? Brent Runyon tells the story, which was produced by Jay Allison , part of his Life Stories series, with help from Christina Egloff and funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

      <description>Oh faithless and perverse generation? How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you?—Matthew 17.

This American Life host Ira Glass and producer Susan Burton spent a week in August recording a suburban Chicago youth group at every stage of their very first mission trip. The teenagers were from Covenant Presbyterian Church in Chicago. They went to West Virginia, to fix up someone's house, and to witness about their faith to strangers. The goal: That they mature from a child's kind of faith to an adult's. There's a boom in mission trips like this right now, a boom that crosses denominations.

Act One
These teenagers are the children the Christian right has in mind when it holds conferences on what's at stake in America's culture war. On the fourteen-hour drive to West Virginia, we listen to the Backstreet Boys and talk about Dawson's Creek. One of the things that's so interesting about these teenagers is the odd mix of Christian and secular pop in their lives. (13 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act Two
The teenagers arrive in West Virginia and take a look around. (4 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act Three
Hardships begin. Their leader gets sick. One of their projects fails. (6 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act Four
One great thing about staying in a camp of 130 other Christians is the much-better-than-in-school chance of meeting a nice, cute Christian boy. (8 minutes)

      <description>David Rakoff visits Iceland, where the government is careful not to disturb certain boulders because some people believe that elves live there.

Stories about rats in the city, from Kate Aurthur (former rat columnist for New York magazine), and from a Mark Lewis documentary called Rat . When rats arrive in our homes, we remember why we as a species wanted to tame nature in the first place. It feels like a contest of man versus nature in which nature actually has a fighting chance. (5 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Building everything that comprises modern life—constructing cities and suburbs both—means trampling nature. And that bothers some people. They want to keep nature at hand, even in the city. David Rakoff visited Reykjavik, Iceland, where the government is careful not to disturb certain boulders when it builds roads because some people believe that invisible &quot;hidden people&quot;—like elves—live at those sites. (17 minutes)
By David Rakoff

Act Two
Unlike Reykjavik, some cities don't coddle citizens in their idiosyncratic beliefs about nature. We hear New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani react (with vehemence) to a man who believes New Yorkers should have the right to keep ferrets in their homes. (5 minutes)

Act Four
True stories of what happens when children are allowed to bring nature's own creatures into the house as pets. When it comes to rodents, fish and amphibians, it often works out badly...for the pets. We hear especially from one Chicago high-school freshman, who spoke with producer Starlee Kine. If you're looking for &quot;bite toad,&quot; this is it. (5 minutes)

      <description>Have mandatory minimum sentences gone too far?

Host Ira Glass with former Congressman Daniel Rostenkowski. When Rostenkowski began a term in federal prison, he met for the first time people who'd been locked up under harsh drug laws that he'd voted for himself. &quot;The whole thing's a sham,&quot; he declares. He confesses that he didn't really understand the mandatory minimum sentences he voted for in the 1980s; he just followed the lead of colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, which drafted the laws. (6 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
The story of how a person could be sentenced to 19 years for drug possession—even if police found no drugs, drug money, residue or paraphrenalia—even if it's a first offense. Dorothy Gaines was an Alabama nurse with no prior record and no physical evidence of any drugs who was sentenced to 19 years. The only evidence against her was the testimony of admitted drug dealers who received reduced sentences in exchange for naming co-conspirators. (14 minutes)
By Ira Glass
Song:“Run On” by Moby

Act Two
We hear the history of why these drug laws were enacted from a firsthand witness. Eric Sterling was the lawyer in charge of drug laws for the House Judiciary Committee during the 1980s, when mandatory minimums were put in place. He tells the inside story of how the laws were rammed through Congress—with no input from judges, prison wardens or police officers—as part of a frenzy of get-tough posturing led not by Republicans, but by Democrats. (15 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act Three
Judges give their opinions of the drug sentencing laws. Terry Hatter is the Chief U.S. District Judge for the Central District of California. He says that under the current federal guidelines, 20 percent of the time he can't give the sentence he thinks will be fair. Judge Morris Lasker, of the Southern District of New York, a veteran of over 30 years on the bench, stopped hearing drug cases for several years. Eighty-six percent of federal judges believe the current guidelines need to be loosened. (6 minutes)

Host Ira Glass describes the moment when black single mothers became a national political issue—and a national symbol. It was 1965, when a young Assistant Secretary of Labor named Daniel Patrick Moynihan issued a report calling for action on the issue of African-American single mothers, and black leaders, including the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., opposed him. (3 minutes)

Act One
Barbara Clinkscales grew up in Chicago's public housing projects, had her first child when she was 15, and is now—over two decades later—struggling to get her teenage son to finish his senior year of high school. Barbara is a working mom, with a network of close friends who look out for her. She is so fiercely insistent that her son graduate high school that she personally takes him to his first class every day. This remarkable look at daily life on Chicago's south side was assembled from Barbara's tapes by producer Alix Spiegel with funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. (33 minutes)

Host Ira Glass with Rory Evans, who describes the day her father fired his own mother from their family business, a machine shop called Evans Industries. Some estimates say that 40 to 60 percent of our nation's gross domestic product is created by family businesses, but talking to anyone who works for one of these companies, you end up wondering...how? (5 minutes)

      <description>Stories designed to provide some small sense of hope about American politics.

Host Ira Glass with an idealistic would-be politician in California. The puzzle of American politics is that our political system is filled with idealistic people, but few of our candidates for top office seem either idealistic or capable of inspiring passion. (5 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
A campaign diary from writer Michael Lewis from four years ago, about a politician you've heard a lot about: John McCain...and the story of a moment when the opposite of normal politics became normal politics. Lewis's campaign diaries are collected in his book Trail Fever: Spin Doctors, Rented Strangers, and Thumb Wrestlers on the Road to the White House. (15 minutes)
By Michael Lewis

By Dan Savage
Song:“To Serve Mankind” by Mono Puff

Act Three

      <description>Stories of people drawn to some idea, some picture, some &quot;thing&quot; that they just want to be.

The story of Jug Burkett, a businessman in Dallas and a Vietnam vet, who years ago routinely started checking the bona fides of anyone in the news who claimed to have served in the Vietnam war. He says he's found hundreds of fakers, and he says that one of the tricky things about the fakers is that they often seem more like The Real Thing than real vets do. (5 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
The story of someone trying and trying to get close to The Real Thing, and why it was so difficult. Kelly McEvers was a newspaper writer here in Chicago and started to get interested in stories she was hearing about girl gang members. So she got an assignment and tried to get to know them. She found herself changing the way she dressed, changing the way she talked, changing herself to become more like a real gang girl. (13 minutes)

      <description>Three stories, three people, and three sets of maps.

Amy McGuiness flies tourists to the North Pole who pay thousands of dollars for the privilege. When you get to the Pole, it looks exactly like all the other ice you've been staring at for hours. The tourists climb out of the plane and they take pictures. In addition, most people now spend time looking at Global Positioning Devices, which tell them, yes, this is in fact the North Pole. (4 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
John Bowe decided to visit a friend of his who was in the peace corp in Mali, in West Africa. But he chose the most difficult possible route to get there. He decided to hitchhike across the Sahara desert using a 1,000-mile-long remote route that most hitchhikers avoid. He purchased no special gear and carried a small bag filled mostly with books, a change of clothes and one Michelin map. But the map was used to literally get him off the grid. (19 minutes)

Song:“Let's Get Lost” by Chet Baker

Act Two
It can be frightening to get lost, but what if you could adapt the thrill of being lost, the pleasure of being lost, to safe parameters? Just get a little lost. Is it even possible? Or is that playing with fire, where you're sure to get burned? Writer David Sedaris has these thoughts. (14 minutes).

When she was 21, Julia Sweeney got a job as a bartender's assistant and stole between ten and fifteen thousand dollars in cash. She describes the thrill of stealing, and how she justified her thefts to herself, and—oddest of all—how she became a more religious Roman Catholic during her crime spree.

      <description>It turns out that not falling in love, not doing our jobs, not spending time with our families is every bit as vivid and complicated an experience as doing something.

Ira reads a very brief excerpt from a short story from writer Stuart Dybek called &quot;We Didn't.&quot; Dybek fills 11 pages, thousands of words, describing all the things two people do when they're not doing something. (3 minutes) &quot;We Didn't&quot; appears in The Best American Short Stories: 1994.
By Stuart Dybek Ira Glass

Act One
This story is part memoir, part philosophical inquiry into the nature of not doing things. Writer Geoff Dyer had always wanted to write a biography about D.H. Lawrence, and chronicles all the things that keep him from ever starting. This, he says, is how most of us lead our lives: Avoiding the things we think we should be doing. This is an excerpt from his book called Out of Sheer Rage: Wrestling with D.H. Lawrence. (16 minutes)
By Geoff Dyer
Song:“When I Write the Book” by Nick Lowe

Act Two
What do we do when we're not doing something? Not writing a book, not doing our jobs, not falling in love? Sometimes we just feel self-conscious. Sometimes we spend a lot of time explaining ourselves. Sometimes both. Danny Hoch demonstrates, in this monologue from his one-person show Jails, Hospitals and Hip Hop . His show is available on CD from his website . (8 minutes)
By Danny Hoch

Act Three
Writer/Comedian Amanda Marks shares the story of a couple that didn't fall in love, didn't get together, didn't form a future. Then coincidence and fate kick in...confusingly. (10 minutes)

      <description>We accompany a Hollywood screenwriter as he tries to sell a movie idea and find ourselves asking, is the art of commerce better than the art of art?

Host Ira Glass lays out the premise of this week's show. (2 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
A story that takes place at the crossroads where art meets commerce—a place where we can ask the question: Is the art of commerce better than the art of art? Writer (and occasional screenwriter) Sandra Tsing Loh accompanies a Hollywood screenwriter as he tries to sell a movie idea—a comedy in the style of Liar Liar. (19 minutes)
By Sandra Loh

Act Two
Writer/performer Danny Hoch performs a monologue taken from his one man show, Jails, Hospitals and Hip-Hop. It's a story about a guy who's been locked up for doing the most American activity possible: Selling stuff on the street (in this case Bart Simpson/O.J. Simpson t-shirts). His show is available on CD from his website. (5 minutes)
By Danny Hoch
Song:“Ten Commandments of Bart” by Bart Simpson

Act Three
Becoming a salesman can make you more confident and happy, make you ignore it when someone tells you &quot;no&quot;...and why that might be a bad thing. The story of a man who sold radio advertising. (11 minutes)

The story of the lengths a father will go to to retrieve a lost teddy bear, and why—after he's enlisted many other parents to help him wade through tens of thousands of bags of trash to find it—none of the parents involved think he's nuts. (5 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
The story begun in the Prologue continues. As it continues, it takes on the exact narrative structure of the movie Saving Private Ryan. (7 minutes)

Song:“Tony's Theme” by The Pixies

Act Two
Photographer Joel Meyerowitz decided to go on a last big trip with his father Hy, who has Alzheimer's. Joel also brought his own son. The purpose of the trip? To try to get close to a part of Hy's personality that Alzheimer's has eradicated and see if it might be possible to jumpstart some of his memories. Joel and his son decide to make a movie of the trip. We hear some of the very funny, very moving raw footage. The film, Pop, aired on the PBS program Frontline. (24 minutes)

      <description>Stories in which young people take matters into their own hands, broadcast for the tenth anniversary of the crackdown at Tiananmen Square.

On the tenth anniversary of the crackdown at Tiananmen Square, we hear from Wen Huang, who was part of the student movement. He says that the students weren't fighting for democracy, at least not as it's been widely understood in the West. He—and other former student activists from China—say the protests were an expression of sheer pleasure in living, a rock-n-roll bravado, a desire for a better future. But they never wanted to see American-style democracy or the overthrow of the Communist government, or anything so grand. (5 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
More stories from Wen Huang that contradict what you think you know about the 1989 student uprising in China. (9 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act Two
If part of the impulse behind the Tiananmen Square uprising was the pure desire to feel like life had possibility, that the future had potential...that impulse was behind another movement. This one among young people in Eastern Europe back before the Berlin Wall fell. The movement had to do with music: jazz. We hear an excerpt from Josef Skvorecky's essay &quot;Red Music&quot; (collected in his book Talkin' Moscow Blues ), about how jazz in Czechoslovakia during the 1940s and 1950s seemed to pose a threat, first to the Nazi occupation, then to the Communist authorities. The story is read by Broadway actor Ed Dixon. (17 minutes)
By Ed Dixon Josef Skvorecky

Act Three
Since the high school shootings in Littleton, Colorado, parents and teachers are looking for warning signs that the children in their lives might suddenly strike out. But the dividing line between normal childhood aggression and social pathology can be hard to spot. Writer Paul Bravmann tells a story from his own boyhood in a West coast suburb about the difficulty of spotting that line. (14 minutes)

The first time Eddie set foot in a black nation in Africa, a man at the border found out he was an American—a black American—and said &quot;Welcome home.&quot; But Eddy Harris says the Motherland doesn't really feel much like home. He describes his year-long trip through Africa, and how it all came to a head on a river trip in Zaire. He recounts the trip in his book Native Stranger: A Black American's Journey into the Heart of Africa. (5 minutes)

Act One
Twenty-six-year-old Jose William Huezo Soriano—a.k.a. Weasel—grew up in Los Angeles. Under new sentencing laws, he got deported to his parents' home country of El Salvador, a country he has not seen since he was five years old. He has no memories of the country, no immediate family there, and people have a hard time understanding his Spanish. He records an audio diary of his life in exile for radio producer Joe Richman, part of Joe's Radio Diaries series. (26 minutes)

      <description>What if you asked people for advice and actually took ALL of the advice that everyone gave you? Sarah Vowell tried exactly that.

When Adam and Jamie were kids, Jamie would always ask for Adam's advice, but he didn't want to hear what Adam would say himself. Instead, he wanted Adam to pretend to be an Israeli commando he once knew, named Yakov. Yakov seemed to know things that Adam didn't. But still Jamie wouldn't take the advice. Which raises the question: What would it take? When we give advice, we witness the the puniness of reason when compared with the vastness of human inertia and emotion. (6 minutes)

      <description>Two do-gooders try to change things in their hometown for the better. But the more they try, the more people resent them.

When Brigid starting going blind, she tried to hire someone to drive her around. Only problem was, the guy she hired wanted to carry her groceries, hold her arm as she walked to the curb...he tried to help her in too many ways. When we try to help others we tend to think it's a simple thing, when in fact it's as complicated as any human relationship, which is why it's so easy to blunder. (4 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Jackie and Kenny Wharton were kids in the tiny town of Canalou, Missouri, off of old Highway 61. They moved away for 40 years but always dreamed of moving back. After Kenny retired, they finally did. Canalou had fallen on hard times. They hoped to do a few things to help restore some of the spirit it had when they were kids: Modest, innocent things, maybe start a softball league, build a place for kids to play ball, maybe pave a few streets. And the more they tried, the more people resented them. After three years, they realized that something had changed in Canalou that would take a lot more than two do-gooders could fix. This is the story of what went wrong. (33 minutes)

      <description>Fundamentalist Christians and Orthodox Jews are combining forces to breed a perfect red cow that could bring about the end of the world.

When the end of time comes, what videos will we watch? Under fundamentalist Christian doctrine, the first thing that will happen during the End Time is that all the good Christians will be whisked suddenly to heaven. We hear clips from Left Behind —a video designed to be played after all the Christians have vanished, by all the people left behind. It explains what happened to all the Christians, and what the Bible says about the Apocalypse, the 1000-year reign of Jesus on Earth, the End Time. Videos and books like this are big business now. (5 minutes) All of the Left Behind books, including Apollyon : The Destroyer Is Unleashed and Left Behind : A Novel of the Earth's Last Days , both by authors Tim F. Lahaye, Jerry B. Jenkins, with The Vanishings (Left Behind - The Kids) , a novel for kids on the Rapture, also by the same authors, are available through Amazon.com . Visit the extensive Left Behind website for more—and don't miss the Left Behind commercials you can view on this site; they're both riveting and disturbing. You can get more detailed info on all the Left Behind books and videos here, all while you send your email friends electronic postcards featuring graphics inspired by the Rapture. (5 minutes)

Act One
When Anne Staggs started to fall for an inmate named Charles in the Texas prison system, she was up against odds as daunting as they ever get for two people. It was against the rules, possibly dangerous, and could have gotten her fired.

      <description>What happens if you're too good at throwing everything out and starting over?

The tendency toward self-reinvention is so deep in American culture that we have an entire industry, a self-help industry, telling us how to transform ourselves into someone new. And usually, we see this as a positive thing. But what happens if you're too good at it, at throwing everything off, starting over from scratch?

Act One
Over the course of his life, Keith Aldrich was a child of the Depression in Oklahoma; a preacher-in-training in booming California; an aspiring Hollywood actor; in the 1950s, a self-styled Beat writer, and then a man in a gray flannel suit; in the 1960s, a member of the New York literati, and then a hippie; in the 1970s, a denizen of the suburbs with a partying, Ice Storm kind of life. Then in the 80's, when the moral majority helped put Ronald Reagan in office, he became a born-again Christian. Today we're devoting our entire show to story of Keith's life, as told by one of his nine children, Gillian Aldrich. (33 minutes)

      <description>Three stories of people pretending to be something they're not, and what happens to them.

Viola disguises herself as a man, takes a job working for this guy with whom she promptly falls in love. He believes the pretense: He thinks Viola is a man, so he never gives her a second look. This is the problem with pretending: If you're successful, and people actually believe you, you can get stuck in an identity you don't want. The other problem is this: Some people actually come to believe they are the person they're pretending to be. (4 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Ron Copeland is a historical interpreter at the Conner Prairie Living History Museum, outside of Indianapolis. For several months a year, in his job, he pretends to be a slaveowner in the old south. People come looking to experience the slave experience. He screams at them. He bosses them around. And it's starting to change him. (14 minutes)
By Alix Spiegel
Song:“The Boy Done Wrong Again” by Belle and Sebastian

Act Two
There's the pretending we do as individuals, and there's the organized pretending that happens in group therapy sessions, in the roleplaying games that are done in some clinical settings.

      <description>Stories of the lives of prisoners in the United States, and the lives of their families.

Host Ira Glass with jazz musician Ed Ryder, who was in prison in Pennsylvania for twenty years for a murder it was later proven he did not commit. Ryder played jazz in the pen and out of the pen. He says playing jazz for inmates is a completely different experience. The culture of prison is completely different, and it even affects how prisoners listen to jazz. (4 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Over two decades ago, not long after he got out of Texas prison for robbery, Ray Hill got a job at his local public radio station, KPFT in Houston. He started a weekly program about Texas prisons that's now the leading muckraking voice in the state when it comes to exposing graft and corruption in prison facilities there. He also does something else that makes it one of the most unusual and remarkable radio programs in the country: For most of an hour, he takes calls from people whose families are in prison; they talk to their loved ones behind bars, over the radio. Ray explains, and we hear clips from his show. (14 minutes)
By Ray Hill

Act Two
As the number of female prisoners climbs, visiting rooms are packed on Mother's Day. Eighty percent of female inmates have children at home.

By Amanda Coyne

Act Three
A reading of a pamphlet written by ex-con Stephen Donaldson for heterosexual men who are about to enter prison, about how to &quot;hook up&quot; with a stronger man —&quot;daddy&quot; or &quot;jocker&quot;—who'll provide protection in return for sex. He explains the rules and mores that govern this part of American prison culture. There's no graphic language and there are no graphic images in this story, but it does acknowledge the existence of sexual acts. Read by Larry DiStasi. (6 minutes)
By Larry DiStasi Stephen Donaldson

Act Four
What happens when you go into a place—in this case a prison—where there are all sorts of codes about what you're never supposed to say...and you say every one of them. Rick Reynolds tells a story from his one-man show (and CD) All Grown Up and No Place to Go , about performing stand-up comedy at a maximum security prison just before Christmas a few years ago.

      <description>A rookie cop and a squirrel, and other stories of first days on the job.

Writer Jack Hitt talks about his daughter Tarpeley's first day in her new school. It was her first &quot;first day&quot; of any kind. The kids at the school put her through a kind of hazing. This often happens at all sorts of first days: in military academies, for doctors-in-training, in street gangs. And why is hazing so common? Hazing is so primal—and intimate. As if the existence of The First Day—the simple presence of an outsider who wants to be an insider—is so profound, so disturbing to any group, that they have to crush you, prove you harmless, before they can bring you in as family. (6 minutes)
By Ira Glass Jack Hitt

Act One
Dishwasher Pete tells the story of his first day washing dishes on an oil rig off the coast of Louisiana. He'd heard he'd get a hazing when he stepped foot on the rig. How cussing can save you when reason treads, and other lessons of his job there. Listeners who want to buy Pete's zine — where this story first appeared — can get it by sending a dollar to Dishwasher, P.O. Box 8213, Portland, OR 97207. (12 minutes)

Alix Spiegel reports on an entire community that's turned its back on easy money—for now. Nine years ago a native American community in Minnesota—the Mille Lacs band of Ojibwe—built a casino. The reservation had been poor for a century, but soon they were the second biggest tourist attraction in the state, second only to the Mall of America. They had hundreds of millions of dollars...but of course, too much money can be as destructive as too little...and it's unclear what to do with all the cash. (22 minutes)
By Alix Spiegel

Act Two
Seattle writer Dan Savage on how a windfall check he got in the mail is hurting his family life. (11 minutes)
By Dan Savage

Act Three
How one woman learned to stop worrying and start spending. Liz Gilbert and her husband Michael Cooper explain how their different ideas about handling money always divided them—until they stumbled into a $10,000 windfall. (8 minutes)

      <description>How irrational fear of germs means that you aren't going to get good apple cider in your local supermarket this fall.

The story of a White House scandal from the year 1881. President James Garfield lay dying of a gunshot wound during that summer. But because our nation is crazy when it comes to the President, and because the White House is a national movie screen onto which we project a whole array of fears and misplaced idealism, Americans projected one of the big fears of the day onto Garfield. Namely, the fear of sewer gas. Rumors abounded that Garfield was not dying from the bullet in his back, but from vapors rising from the antiquated White House toilets. It became so serious that an independent expert was brought in to give a bipartisan assessment of the problem. The Senate voted to spend $300,000 to build a new White House, a sanitary one, right next to the original White House. And it would be nice to believe that all of this was the kind of hysteria that was only possible before the germ theory of disease was proven. But in fact, now we know how diseases are transmitted. Now that we know that there's no such thing as &quot;sewer gas.&quot; But still, when it comes to germs, and our fear of disease, we are still irrational beings. Ira talks with Nancy Tomes, author of a history on the subject, The Gospel of Germs . (6 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Reporter Hanna Rosen did an investigation of those new antibacterial products—the antibacterial soaps and lotions, the antibacterial pizza cutter and linen and underwear. In her article, she mocked these products as ineffective. She mocked the people who used them. And then, she found herself seized with a kind of anti-germ dementia. (11 minutes)

Song:“Germ Free Adolescents” by X-Ray Spex

Act Two
Germs were first understood at the turn of the 20th century and it turns out that the aesthetics of everyday life during this century—the way we dress, the way we groom ourselves, the way we make our homes—are all partly a response to this newfangled idea of germs. (4 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act Three
The burden of keeping germs from hurting us in our everyday lives has fallen mostly on women, from the time science fully understood about the existence of germs. After all, women had to keep the home clean, had to prepare food safely. We hear from Emily Colas's funny and disturbingly honest account of her obsession with cleanliness and germs, from her book Just Checking . (5 minutes)
By Emily Colas

Act Four
Reporter, author and apple farmer Frank Browning on how irrational fear of germs means that you aren't going to get good apple cider in your local supermarket this fall. (15 minutes)

By Ira Glass

Act One
Two brothers set out with a friend to cross America on horseback. They take a tape recorder with them to make a kind of audio journal of their trip.

      <description>The world redrawn by the five senses.

Ralph Gentles and five other people spent each summer creating a map of every crack, every depression, every protrusion, every pothole in the sidewalks of New York City. We hear why, and we hear all the things their map does not include. Map making means ignoring everything in the world but the one thing being mapped, whether it's cracks in sidewalks or the homes of Hollywood stars. And, according to cartographer Denis Wood, we live in the Age of Maps: more than 99.9 percent of all the maps that have ever existed have been made in the last 100 years. (4 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Denis Wood talks with host Ira Glass about the maps he's made of his own neighborhood, Boylan Heights in Raleigh, North Carolina. They include a traditional street locator map, a map of all the sewer and power lines under the earth's surface, a map of how light falls on the ground through the leaves of trees, a map of where all the Halloween pumpkins are each year, and a map of all the graffiti in the neighborhood. In short, he's creating maps that are more like novels, trying to describe everyday life. In 2010, Denis compiled these maps into the book Everything Sings . See an excerpt from the book, including the introduction by Ira Glass, here . (8 minutes)

Act Two
Jack Hitt visits Toby Lester, who has mapped all the ambient sounds in his world: the hum of the heater, the fan on the computer. Jack's most recent book is Bunch of Amateurs . (12 minutes)

Song:“Way over Yonder in the Minor Key” by Billy Bragg and Wilco

Act Three

      <description>We attempt to bridge the gap of misunderstanding between camp people and non-camp people.

Camp kids explain how their non-camp friends and their non-camp loved ones have no idea why camp is the most important thing in their lives. Most of this hour takes place at a pair of camps in Michigan—Lake of the Woods, a girls camp, and Greenwoods, a boys camp. The two camps share facilities and activities and essentially function as one camp . (3 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
David Himmel is a college sophomore and a former camper who became a counselor. He says all the best experiences of his life have been at camp or with camp people. We follow him around and discover why. He creates songs that become camp traditions. He has his own fan club of four thirteen-year-old girls. He coaches one of the boys in his cabin when the boy wants to try and kiss a girl he likes. David is the author of A Camp Story: The History of Lake of the Woods &amp; Greenwoods Camps . (7 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act Two
Sure, kids today are sophisticated. But get them living in the woods for a few days, and they revert to some of the most stupidly primitive forms of entertainment known since the dawn of civilization. Specifically: they love scary stories. Every camp has a camp ghost story. We hear one. And we go with the Sioux cabin of ten year olds as they try an experiment in fear, in the dark, in front of a mirror in their cabin. (7 minutes).
By Ira Glass

Act Three
We asked listeners to call and write with their camp stories. Hundreds did. We hear a selection. (7 minutes)
By Listeners Like You

Act Four
Camp Lake of the Woods holds a fake Indian powwow during the summer. This kind of fake Native American-ness has been a part of camping in America since organized camping began a century ago. And ceremonies like this are just part of making the business run for any camp. By having traditions and lots of songs in which campers sing about their loyalty to their own camp, camps create repeat customers. It's an economic imperative. Of course, it's also really fun. (5 minutes) Read more about the history of Indian &quot;traditions&quot; in summer camps in Philip Joseph Deloria's Playing Indian .
By Ira Glass

Act Five
NPR's Adam Davidson tells a true story from his own childhood. He was sent to a camp run by the Israeli army at its own training facility. He shot an M-16, sure, but in other ways, army life was amazingly similar to other summer camps: It was all about loyalty to your group, loyalty to your team. Adam is one of the founders of NPR's Planet Money . (7 minutes)

Host Ira Glass describes what thousands of people do all over America on our holiday weekends: we go to historic sites with our kids and stare at bricks and statues, trying to feel some connection with the past. It's not easy. (5 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Sarah Vowell and her twin sister Amy re-trace the Trail of Tears. They visit the town in Georgia that was the capital of the Cherokee Nation before the Cherokee were expelled. They enjoy a tourist trap hotel in Chatanooga. They go to Ross's Landing, the embarkment point for the water route of the Trail of Tears. (28 minutes)

      <description>Stories in which fathers and their kids sit down and try to have an honest moment together.

We ask 18-year-old Chana Wiliford and her father in Texas if they'd be willing to have a conversation on tape in which each of them gets to ask the other the questions they've never asked before. In the conversation, Chana is half his child, half his peer. (4 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
More tape of Chana and her father Bob Wiliford discussing all the things they've never talked about before. Though Chana grew up in Waco, Texas, she left to go to college in Philadelphia. Her dad works for the phone company. Her parents have been married and divorced and re-married to each other three times, but she doesn't understand why. In this interview, she gets to ask about it. (7 minutes)
By Chana Wiliford

Act Two
In this part of the show, stories about fathers who haven't gotten quite so close with their children. Two-thirds of all African American children are raised in single parent homes, usually by mothers and/or grandmothers. Sanantonio Brooks is 18 and lives in a big Chicago public housing project. He wanted to interview some of the young fathers in his building, guys his age who he's known since he was a kid — guys who had kids as teenagers. He wanted to talk about whether they are better fathers than their own fathers were. (12 minutes)
By Sanantonio Brooks

Act Three
Another case study of a dad who's waiting to feel closer to his kid. Writer Dan Savage writes the syndicated sex advice column Savage Love. He and his boyfriend Terry spent months trying to adopt and finally adopted a baby boy. Terry, who has a heart of gold, bonded right away. For Dan, it's taking longer. And to people who fear the very idea of gay couples bringing up a baby boy, Dan has this message: he and Terry are like a traditional 1950's couple. Dan goes off to earn the money; Terry stays at home and raises the kid. (10 minutes)

      <description>Two stories of people who try to cross the color line, and why it's still so hard.

Ira reads from an editorial from a 1957 newspaper in Jackson, Mississippi. It tries to scare white southerners about the NAACP by describing a Chicago human rights campaign called &quot;Take a Negro Boy Home Tonight.&quot; The idea behind the campaign? &quot;Racism can be combated by intimate relationships between Negro boys and white girls.&quot; No such campaigns really existed in Chicago. Ira explains that in this show we hear from two people who tried to do what southerners feared so much. (3 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Rich Robinson's father is black, his mother is white. They married during the civil rights movement, believing the whole nation was moving toward greater and greater integration. After having three children, they divorced. Rich's mom went back to her segregated white world. His dad returned to his segregated black world. In this story, Rich sets out to discover the role that race played in their divorce and the role it played in their initial attraction. It's something he'd never discussed with them before. And he wants something more personal: advice on whether they think he should marry white or black. (32 minutes)

Durrell was a professional musician. He toured Asia, Brazil, Canada, gigs in Paris. Now he teaches chorus at a high school on Chicago's south side. Touring was easier. Durrell explains the frustrations of being a music teacher. We hear him try to cancel the last concert of the year...and how his students try to change his mind. (5 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
A case study of how children are asked to live the unlived lives of their parents. Author David Sedaris had a father who loved jazz but played no instrument himself. Instead, he dreamt that his children would learn to play and form a little jazz combo. He sent David to take guitar lessons. David, however, had dreams of his own. David's most recent book is Let's Explore Diabetes With Owls . (15 minutes)
By David Sedaris

Act Two
As a teenager, Sarah Vowell was not casual about music lessons — music became her life. She was in marching band, jazz band, Band One, symphony band, pep band and the Bozeman Recorder Ensemble. Here Sarah recalls all the things she learned in music class that had nothing to with music. Sarah's most recent book is Unfamiliar Fishes . (17 minutes)

      <description>The story of a town that started with something huge—the falls—and built nothing lasting from it.

The modern history of Niagara Falls can be divided roughly into three phases: Schemers who came in trying to exploit the Falls for tourism and failed; schemers who came in and tried to exploit the Falls for hydroelectric power, who've all gone; and the people who are left in Niagara today. Our show is about this last group: People who live in the aftermath. Some of them have made their peace with what Niagara has become, some haven't.

A high school student named Rebecca tells the story of a friend of hers who changed over the course of four years from a preppy alternative kid to a member of the Latina clique to a ghetto girl to a Clueless girl (a girl who models herself after the girls in the film and TV show Clueless ). It's hard to imagine many boys changing style this quickly, this willfully, this many times. It's very girl, transforming yourself head to toe every year just because you can, and because you're expected to be that obsessed with how you look. (6 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One

      <description>Stories of people struggling to redefine monogamy, to stay monogamous, and what we should make of these ad hoc experiments in everyday life.

In the early stages of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, there was a period when one of the questions raised by the whole affair had to do with monogamy. Around that time, Roy Romer, the Governor of Colorado and Chair of the Democratic Party, admitted that for 16 years he'd had a relationship with an aide that his wife and family knew about. We hear tape from Romer's remarkable press conference in which he urged people to talk more realistically about how they really live in their marriages, instead of pretending they are monogamous. Northwestern University scholar Laura Kipnis , author of an article in Critical Inquiry about fidelity and monogamy in public life, says we have to examine why so many couples are deserting monogamy. It's a social revolt, she says, like wildcat strikes. (7 minutes)

      <description>Ira teaches Sarah Vowell how to drive with some advice from the hosts of Car Talk.

Host Ira Glass with Brooklyn schoolteacher Melissa Cantor, who reads from a how-to manual written by a sixth-grade student. It's about how to protect yourself against unwanted visitors. Like the Wolfman. Dinosaurs. Aliens. We make how-to's to help ourselves believe the world is an orderly place that we can control, even when we can't. And how-to's go back to the very beginnings of our identity as English-speaking people: when it became legal to publish whatever you wanted in England in 1696, the books that immediately became the most popular were how-to's. They explained how — through hard work, education, self-control — you could better yourself and move up into what we think of today as the middle class. And in fact, they appeared before there was a substantial middle class; people read the books and created a middle class. Our identity is bound up in the very idea of &quot;how to&quot; — the notion that it's possible to better yourself, to become a different person. (7 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Ira teaches Sarah Vowell how to drive with some advice from Tom and Ray Maggliozi, the hosts of NPR's Car Talk. It turns out that although we think of how-to's as the most rational thing in the world — follow the simple instructions and you'll learn — in real life, they're anything but simple. (26 minutes)

      <description>When someone tries to tell you a little bit more about themselves than you'd really rather know.

Margy's a reporter. When she told her dad that she wanted to write a story about him, he said sure. Then he called back to say that he was &quot;so glad that she wanted to see him without all his masks.&quot; She was stunned. She told him she didn't want to see him without all his masks. &quot;Leave the mask on,&quot; she said. Her family already talks about all their feelings, what could he possibly come up with? There are certain things you just don't want to know about the people you love. (3 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Margy Rochlin sees a new side of her father when, in his seventies, he becomes a monologist like Spalding Gray. Her dad, Fred Rochlin, is a huge hit. He tells stories about his experiences in World War II and enters worlds his grown children never imagined him in. But sometimes Margy finds herself hearing things she'd just as soon not know about him. Fred went on to compile his stories in the book Old Man in a Baseball Cap: A Memoir of World War II . (31 minutes)

      <description>The story of a teenager, illegal drug use, lying, stealing, and a kid's life changed completely when he heard how he sounded on the phone.

Host Ira Glass explains why some old answering machine messages from a decade ago have such power for him: there's a special power to recordings of phone conversations. The phone is intimate — more intimate than a photograph. Even when the person on the phone is a public figure like Lyndon Johnson. He plays some tapes from the Simon &amp; Schuster audiobook of Johnson phone tapes, Taking Charge, The Johnson White House Tapes, 1963-1964 , by Michael Beschloss, to demonstrate. (7 minutes)

Act Two
Sure you can try to get your pop songs onto records, or on the radio, or onto MTV. But what happens if your medium of choice is ... the telephone? Before they had record contracts, the band They Might Be Giants distributed their songs through the medium of Answering Machine. They created their own Dial-a-Song line. They say it taught them a lot about songwriting, because they could hear which songs people hated, because people hung up on the bad songs. It taught them how to do better musical arrangements for their songs. Sarah Vowell visited John Linnell and John Flansberg in Brooklyn and talked to them about Dial-a-Song. (15 minutes)

Act One
D. Travers Scott and his boyfriend spent six months gathering data on their own relationship and put together a report on it in the form of a corporate annual report.

Act Two
Alex Melamid and Vitaly Komar hired a polling firm to investigate what people want to see in paintings. Then, using the data, they painted what people want. It turned out to be a landscape, with a mountain and a lake, and deer, and a family, and George Washington. Then they applied these techniques to music with composer David Soldier . They surveyed audiences about what kind of instruments and topics they liked most in their songs. Then they produced one song based on what people most want to hear — and one song based on what they hate the most. The one people hate includes bagpipes, children singing, lyrics about holidays and religion, wild volume and tempo changes. If you'd like a copy of the songs featured in this segment, visit Melamid and Komar's website. You can buy both the Most Wanted and Most Unwanted Songs directly from them. (11 minutes)

      <description>The story of Harold Washington and the white backlash that was set off when he became Chicago's first black mayor.

A look at the Chicago political machine in the days before our story begins.

Act One
A history of the brief mayoral career of Harold Washington, and its lessons for black and white America, as told by people close to him. Many are activists and politicians: Lu Palmer, Judge Eugene Pincham, Congressman Danny Davis, then-alderman Eugene Sawyer. There are people from his administration—Jacky Grimshaw and Grayson Mitchell—and some reporters who followed his story: Vernon Jarrett, Monroe Anderson, Gary Rivlin, Laura Washington (who became his press secretary). Harold Washington died November 25, 1987.  This show was first broadcast ten years later, in 1997. (46 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act Two
Ira Glass talks with David Axelrod, who was an advisor to Harold Washington and to Barack Obama as

Axelrod explained that by 2007, the white Chicago wards that didn’t vote for Harold, overwhelmingly came out for Obama. Then, WBEZ reporter Robert Wildeboer talks to some of those voters, in wards where Harold did badly

Mary and Manfred Rauer have been married 22 years. He's a devout Christian, goes to church every week, reads the Bible every day, was head of his congregation. She's an atheist. They're happy. But there are things they don't understand about each other. How big is the gap of misunderstanding between religious people and secular people? They provide a case study. (5 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Alix Spiegel in Colorado Springs, where a massive prayer project is underway to pray for every person, business, and school. When she arrives, she finds the Christians speak a kind of Christian jargon she does not understand. When she goes to her local contact to discuss it, and to find more sympathetic people to profile, he says that he believes the secular world can never understand what the religious community in Colorado Springs is doing. Alix Spiegel believed the prayers were simply a gesture of goodwill by people toward their neighbors, but soon she finds that in fact, they are something very different. Something medieval.

Brett Leveridge was standing on the subway. A guy comes walking down the platform, stopping in front of each passenger and delivering a quiet verdict: &quot;You're in. You're out. You, you can stay. You — gotta go.&quot; Most people ignored the guy. But Brett found himself, against his will, hoping the guy would give him the thumbs up, and when the guy does, it's thrilling in a very small way: a tiny kindness from a stranger. Brett's story also appears on his website Brettnews , and you can see a graphic recreation of it in our comic book How to Make Radio . (5 minutes)

This is what Geiger ended up doing because of that experience.

      <description>Mona LisaThe darker side of the art world: petty jealousies, competitiveness, failure.

Foreign correspondent Jim Biederman reports from a cell phone inside the Louvre, in front of the Mona Lisa, on what people say while they're standing in front of some of the world's greatest works of art. It turns out to be pretty banal. People talk about dinner. And the price of the paintings. It actually makes you feel bad for artists — a group most of us feel no sympathy for whatsoever. After all, it takes years to develop artistic skills; it's intensely competitive; almost no one makes any money doing it; there are jealousies and unfair treatment; and then, if, somehow, your work is recognized and you end up in a museum like the Louvre, you're even treated badly there. (5 minutes)

An accomplished jazz saxophonist and jazz snob, Ellery listened to his father's tunes, and his own musical taste started to change. (17 minutes)

      <description>The story of two Americans—one white, one black—who go to South Africa and have very different opinions about what they find.

More than England, or Japan or Israel.... When we think of South Africa, it's a more interesting mirror of the United States than nearly any country, because we glimpse a distant echo of the most frightening parts of American society — and the most inspiring. In this prologue, we hear excerpts from a speech Robert Kennedy gave in South Africa in 1966 and an interview with South Africa writer Lewis Nkosi , who remembers how black South Africans imitated black Americans and looked to the American experiment for hope — as many Americans now look to South Africa for hope. (6 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
The first part of Josh Seftel and Rich Robinson's documentary about South Africa. Josh meets people who may be distant South African relatives. He likes them. But because his black friend is with him, he's very nervous that they might be racists. Quizzing them at length at dinner, he finds that one of them is one of Nelson Mandela's doctors. Their kids were very active in the struggle against apartheid. Rich, however, is disturbed by the way they talk about their servants and talk to their servants, and the way they talk to him. Figuring the only way they'll get along again is if they hit the road and get away from Josh's relatives, they start a trek across South Africa, first stopping in an African village. (22 minutes)

Act One
Richard Lyons, from the band Negativland , tells the story of a Xeroxed book he put together for a few friends. It's photos of smashed-up cars in a junkyard.

      <description>Canadians claim they're no different from red-blooded Americans. We put their position to the test.

The true story of a dinner conversation in which several Americans came to realize how many iconic Americans are, in fact, Canadian. &quot;If William Shatner's Canadian,&quot; one insists, &quot;then I could be Canadian.&quot; Another opines that there should be a law against Peter Jennings, a Canadian, hosting a network news program. (6 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
David Rakoff on how he tried to pass as a local once he moved from Toronto to New York. He claims that there must be a chip in his head — or something like it — that automatically tells him when someone or something famous is Canadian. Lorne Greene? Canadian. The American space shuttle? It has a Canadian-built arm. (10 minutes)
By Ira Glass David Rakoff
Song:“Taking Care of Business” by Bachman Turner Overdrive

Act Two
Canadians not getting any respect in two locales: A town called Little Canada, Minnesota; and in Canada, where a guy doing a Canadian-heritage art project gets ribbed by his neighbors, who joke that there is no Canadian culture to celebrate. Then, Sarah Vowell speaks with Ian Brown, formerly the host of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's long-running program Sunday Morning. They arm wrestle over what it means to be a Canadian, what it means to be an American, and whether the two are the same. (18 minutes)

Song:“Rockin' in the Free World” by Neil Young

Act Three
Or is that &quot;Ooting?&quot; 90210 expert Danny Drennan on the pro-Canadian bias in the hit TV show Beverly Hills 90210 now that Canadian Jason Priestly is not just a star of the show, but a producer and director as well. (3 minutes) Then writer Jack Hitt dissects the pro-Canadian bias in ABC's World News Tonight. (8 minutes)

      <description>Twenty-four people put one hand on a Hardbody pickup truck and wait...until only one person is left standing. Plus other stories of people trying to get rich quick.

Ira visits the lottery stand in Chicago that sells more lottery tickets than any other: Hannah's Finer Food &amp; Liquors. There he meets two men who want to get rich quick. Of course, one is trying to win the lottery by spending $3,000 to $4,000 a year on it, so it's hardly something for nothing. But still, he hopes. The other man is a model of hopefulness: he plays the lottery even though he thinks it's fixed and black people never win. That's how much we want to believe we can get something for nothing — even though we know we can't. (4 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
A contest held every year by a Nissan dealership in Longview, Texas in which twenty-four people stand around a $15,000 hard body pickup truck. When the starting whistle blows, each person puts one hand on the truck. They wear gloves, so as not to mess up the paint job. And they stand there ... and stand there ... until one by one, people get tired and drop away, and one person is left standing. That person gets to keep the truck. Excerpts from a documentary ( Hands On A Hard Body ) by filmmakers Rob Bindler, Chapin Wilson and Kevin Morse. We hear a long interview with Benny Perkins, who won the truck one year and was back the year they made their film to try to win again. He says a contest like this is not easy money. You slowly go crazy from sleep deprivation. (17 minutes)
By Rob Bindler Kevin Morse Chapin Wilson
Song:“Six Days on the Road” by Dave Dudley

Act Two
Ira interviews Bob Helms, creator of the zine Guinea Pig Zero, which is about people who make their living by donating their bodies to science for medical experiments. Bob says he wouldn't do spinal tap studies or psychoactive drugs (he calls the people who do the latter &quot;brain sluts&quot;). Overall, he says, it's a much better job than most nine-to-fives.

      <description>Stories of when things go wrong. Really wrong.


Act One
Writer Jack Hitt tells the story of a small town production of Peter Pan , in which the flying apparatus smacks the actors into the furniture, and Captain Hook's hook flies off his arm and hits an old woman in the stomach. By the end of the evening, firemen have arrived and all the normal boundaries between audience and actors have completely dissolved. (23 minutes)
By Jack Hitt
Song:“I Won't Grow Up” by Rickie Lee Jones

Act Two
A medieval village, a 1900-pound brass kettle, marauding visigoths, and a plan to drench invaders with boiling oil that goes awry. From Ron Carlson's book The Hotel Eden , read by Chicago actor Jeff Dorchen. (10 minutes)
By Ron Carlson Jeff Dorchen

Act Three
Wisconsin Public Radio wanted to do something simple: start running Car Talk , the most popular single hour on public radio. But to do this, they had to move their local car show, About Cars , from the morning to the afternoon. The host of About Cars was so upset about this — and what he felt was mistreatment in the past — that he not only refused to move, he started a monthly newsletter about it and organized a public rally. Fifteen hundred people wrote angry letters; 126 swore they'd never give to Wisconsin Public Radio again. The State Legislature got involved. They conducted an audit, which took months. There were hearings. One definition of a fiasco is when something simple and small turns horribly large, and this event fits the bill. We hear from all aggrieved parties, including the Car Talk guys — Tom and Ray Maggliozi. (15 minutes)

      <description>Stories, tributes, and attempts to understand the Chairman of the Board.

Host Ira Glass, with a recording of a 1962 Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr., appearance at the Villa Venice, a club outside Chicago. What's fascinating about Sinatra is how he is so many different people at once, and they're all on display in this recording: sentimental crooner, cruel woman-baiter, bully, goofball. The part of the act with Sammy Davis, Jr. is the oddest. Martin and Sinatra are constantly telling him to get off the stage and make joke after joke, whose main point is simply that he's a black man, onstage with two white men. Chicago writer Rennie Sparks makes the case that Sinatra is mesmerizing because he's every man, every possible man, all rolled into one. (7 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
Michael Ventura, who grew up Sicilian in New York, says that as a kid he thought Sinatra was in his family. His book The Death of Frank Sinatra is not really about Sinatra. It's about men like Ventura, who drew part of their style and sense of self from Frank. He reads from the only section in the book where Sinatra actually appears: an account of a Sinatra concert, circa 1994. He says he wanted to write about the older Sinatra because the older Sinatra contains all the ages of Sinatra. All of them come forward when he sings. (12 minutes)
By Ira Glass Michael Ventura

Act Two
Before Sinatra died, Sarah Vowell appeared on this radio program and made a prediction about how network news would cover Sinatra's death ... and she made a simple plea. We hear whether her prediction came true. This essay appears in Sarah's book, Take the Cannoli: Stories from the New World . (9 minutes)

Song:“My Way” by Sid Vicious

Act Three

      <description>Civil War reenactments, wax museums, simulated coal mines, fake ethnic restaurants, an ersatz Medieval castle, and other re-created worlds that thrive all across America.

Prologue
Host Ira Glass plays clips from Jessica Yu's documentary Men of Reenaction about Civil War reenactments, where the real battle is the one over who is properly authentic and who is not. (5 minutes)

Act One
Host Ira Glass uses Italian author Umberto Eco's essay Travels in Hyperreality as a guidebook to American simulated worlds. Eco says that the urge to create these miniature simulated worlds is a very American impulse — a significant American aesthetic — and one that's not often discussed. Ira visits the Wax Museum at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, stops by a fake coal mine under Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry, and discusses &quot;the poor man's Hearst Castle&quot; — a California hotel called the Madonna Inn. (13 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act Two
Writer Jack Hitt discovers that the world of dinosaurs is a man-made creation, a simulated world that may or may not accurately reflect what happened on earth 100 million years ago. Talking with dinosaur experts like Jack Horner (whose work was the basis of much of the film Jurassic Park ), Hitt finds that most of what you think you know about dinosaurs is probably wrong, and that Americans' ideas about dinosaurs go through &quot;fashions&quot; that reflect the national mood: We believed dinosaurs were more aggressive when we were on the brink of World Wars One and Two. And these days we focus on their family values. (16 minutes)
By Jack Hitt

Act Three
Ira takes a Medieval scholar from the University of Chicago, Michael Camille, to Medieval Times — a chain of fake castles where visitors eat Medieval food and drink Medieval Pepsi and watch a supposed recreation of a Medieval jousting tournament. The scholar finds that there are many historical inaccuracies, but that Medieval Times does capture something essential and interesting about the spirit of the Middle Ages. (19 minutes) Postscript: Sadly, Michael Camille, the wonderful scholar in this story, passed away in 2002. You can read about Camille at the University of Chicago website , or on the UK's Guardian Unlimited website . Michael's books are still in print, though aimed at an academic audience. The one that touches most directly on the things he talks about on our show is Image on the Edge: The Margins of Medieval Art (Reaktion Books - Essays in Art and Culture) .

By Peter Clowney

Act Three
The story of the worst stateside disaster during World War II, at Port Chicago, an ammunition dump for the navy just north of San Francisco. Black workers were assigned to load ammo onto ships under such unsafe conditions that on July 17, 1944, two ships blew up, killing 320 men. When 50 survivors of the blast refused to return to work under the same unsafe conditions, they were court-martialed and sentenced to up to 15 years of hard labor. There have been many attempts to clear the names of these fifty men, including one in 1944 by then-civil rights attorney Thurgood Marshall. Dan Collison spoke with five survivors of the blast about what really happened. See the Long Haul Productions website for more. (20 minutes)

      <description>Stories made from old recordings found in attics and thrift stores.

Host Ira Glass with some tape he recorded of a high school senior prom. Kids goof around in the car after the prom and get lost looking for a friend's house. This tape, Ira says, has all the qualities you look for as a documentary producer: everyone is acting the way they do when there's no tape recorder present. It's intimate and alive, and the kids reveal who they are. This is the quality of all the tape in this episode, though all of it is tape found in basements and attics and thrift stores. Ira calls these stories &quot;accidental documentaries.&quot; (3 minutes)
By Ira Glass

Act One
A Midwestern family records a &quot;letter on tape&quot; to their son, who is in medical school in California. Three decades later, the recording somehow ends up in a thrift store. The tape gives a complicated portrait of what goes on among the family members. Mother wishes that Father were more religious. Daughter is miffed because Dad won't help her solve her financial problems. Dad tells corny jokes and talks enthusiastically about machines, extrusions and drills used for the family business run from the basement — a business everyone else in the family resents. And after the old tapes, Ira interviews the son they were sending these to, Arthur Davis. (26 minutes)
By Ira Glass
